<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="5" summary="table">
<tr><td><span style="margin-left: 1em;">I have known the silence of the stars and of the sea,</span><br />
And the silence of the city when it pauses,<br />
And the silence of a man and a maid,<br />
And the silence for which music alone finds the word,<br />
And the silence of the woods before the winds of spring begin,<br />
And the silence of the sick<br />
When their eyes roam about the room.<br />
And I ask: For the depths<br />
Of what use is language?<br />
A beast of the field moans a few times<br />
When death takes its young:<br />
And we are voiceless in the presence of realities&mdash;<br />
We cannot speak.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A curious boy asks an old soldier</span><br />
Sitting in front of the grocery store,<br />
"How did you lose your leg?"<br />
And the old soldier is struck with silence,<br />
Or his mind flies away,<br />
Because he cannot concentrate it on Gettysburg.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>It comes back jocosely<br />
And he says, "A bear bit it off."<br />
And the boy wonders, while the old soldier<br />
Dumbly, feebly lives over<br />
The flashes of guns, the thunder of cannon,<br />
The shrieks of the slain,<br />
And himself lying on the ground,<br />
And the hospital surgeons, the knives,<br />
And the long days in bed.<br />
But if he could describe it all<br />
He would be an artist.<br />
But if he were an artist there would be deeper wounds<br />
Which he could not describe.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">There is the silence of a great hatred,</span><br />
And the silence of a great love,<br />
And the silence of a deep peace of mind,<br />
And the silence of an embittered friendship.<br />
There is the silence of a spiritual crisis,<br />
Through which your soul, exquisitely tortured,<br />
Comes with visions not to be uttered<br />
Into a realm of higher life.<br />
And the silence of the gods who understand each other without speech.<br />
There is the silence of defeat.<br />
There is the silence of those unjustly punished;<br />
And the silence of the dying whose hand<br />
Suddenly grips yours.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
There is the silence between father and son,<br />
When the father cannot explain his life,<br />
Even though he be misunderstood for it.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">There is the silence that comes between husband and wife.</span><br />
There is the silence of those who have failed;<br />
And the vast silence that covers<br />
Broken nations and vanquished leaders.<br />
There is the silence of Lincoln,<br />
Thinking of the poverty of his youth.<br />
And the silence of Napoleon<br />
After Waterloo.<br />
And the silence of Jeanne d'Arc<br />
Saying amid the flames, "Blessed Jesus"&mdash;<br />
Revealing in two words all sorrow, all hope.<br />
And there is the silence of age,<br />
Too full of wisdom for the tongue to utter it<br />
In words intelligible to those who have not lived<br />
The great range of life.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And there is the silence of the dead.</span><br />
If we who are in life cannot speak<br />
Of profound experiences,<br />
Why do you marvel that the dead<br />
Do not tell you of death?<br />
Their silence shall be interpreted<br />
As we approach them.<br /></td></tr></table>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="5" summary="table">
<tr><td>Antonio loved the Lady Clare.<br />
He caught her to him on the stair<br />
And pressed her breasts and kissed her hair,<br />
And drew her lips in his, and drew<br />
Her soul out like a torch's flare.<br />
Her breath came quick, her blood swirled round;<br />
Her senses in a vortex swound.<br />
She tore him loose and turned around,<br />
And reached her chamber in a bound<br />
Her cheeks turned to a poppy's hue.<br />
<br />
She closed the door and turned the lock,<br />
Her breasts and flesh were turned to rock.<br />
She reeled as drunken from the shock.<br />
Before her eyes the devils skipped,<br />
She thought she heard the devils mock.<br />
For had her soul not been as pure<br />
As sifted snow, could she endure<br />
Antonio's passion and be sure<br />
Against his passion's strength and lure?<br />
Lean fears along her wonder slipped.<br />
<br />
Outside she heard a drunkard call,<br />
She heard a beggar against the wall<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>Shaking his cup, a harlot's squall<br />
Struck through the riot like a sword,<br />
And gashed the midnight's festival.<br />
She watched the city through the pane,<br />
The old Silenus half insane,<br />
The idiot crowd that drags its chain&mdash;<br />
And then she heard the bells again,<br />
And heard the voices with the word:<br />
<br />
Ecco il santo! Up the street<br />
There was the sound of running feet<br />
From closing door and window seat,<br />
And all the crowd turned on its way<br />
The Saint of Poverty to greet.<br />
He passed. And then a circling thrill,<br />
As water troubled which was still,<br />
Went through her body like a chill,<br />
Who of Antonio thought until<br />
She heard the Saint begin to pray.<br />
<br />
And then she turned into the room<br />
Her soul was cloven through with doom,<br />
Treading the softness and the gloom<br />
Of Asia's silk and Persia's wool,<br />
And China's magical perfume.<br />
She sickened from the vases hued<br />
In corals, yellows, greens, the lewd<br />
Twined dragon shapes and figures nude,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>And tapestries that showed a brood<br />
Of leopards by a pool!<br />
<br />
Candles of wax she lit before<br />
A pier glass standing from the floor;<br />
Up to the ceiling, off she tore<br />
With eager hands her jewels, then<br />
The silken vesture which she wore.<br />
Her little breasts so round to see<br />
Were budded like the peony.<br />
Her arms were white as ivory,<br />
And all her sunny hair lay free<br />
As marigold or celandine.<br />
<br />
Her blue eyes sparkled like a vase<br />
Of crackled turquoise, in her face<br />
Was memory of the mad embrace<br />
Antonio gave her on the stair,<br />
And on her cheeks a salt tear's trace.<br />
Like pigeon blood her lips were red.<br />
She clasped her bands above her head.<br />
Under her arms the waxlight shed<br />
Delicate halos where was spread<br />
The downy growth of hair.<br />
<br />
Such sudden sin the virgin knew<br />
She quenched the tapers as she blew<br />
Puff! puff! upon them, then she threw<br />
Herself in tears upon her knees,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>And round her couch the curtain drew.<br />
She called upon St. Francis' name,<br />
Feeling Antonio's passion maim<br />
Her body with his passion's flame<br />
To save her, save her from the shame<br />
Of fancies such as these!<br />
<br />
"Go by mad life and old pursuits,<br />
The wine cup and the golden fruits,<br />
The gilded mirrors, rosewood flutes,<br />
I would praise God forevermore<br />
With harps of gold and silver lutes."<br />
She stripped the velvet from her couch<br />
Her broken spirit to avouch.<br />
She saw the devils slink and slouch,<br />
And passion like a leopard crouch<br />
Half mirrored on the polished floor.<br />
<br />
Next day she found the saint and said:<br />
I would be God's bride, I would wed<br />
Poverty and I would eat the bread<br />
That you for anchorites prepare,<br />
For my soul's sake I am in dread.<br />
Go then, said Francis, nothing loth,<br />
Put off this gown of green snake cloth,<br />
Put on one somber as a moth,<br />
Then come to me and make your troth<br />
And I will clip your golden hair.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span><br />
She went and came. But still there lay,<br />
A gem she did not put away,<br />
A locket twixt her breasts, all gay<br />
In shimmering pearls and tints of blue,<br />
And inlay work of fruit and spray.<br />
St. Francis felt it as he slipped<br />
His hand across her breast and whipped<br />
Her golden tresses ere he clipped&mdash;<br />
He closed his eyes then as he gripped<br />
The shears, plunged the shears through.<br />
<br />
The waterfall of living gold.<br />
The locks fell to the floor and rolled,<br />
And curled like serpents which unfold.<br />
And there sat Lady Clare despoiled.<br />
Of worldly glory manifold.<br />
She thrilled to feel him take and hide<br />
The locket from her breast, a tide<br />
Of passion caught them side by side.<br />
He was the bridegroom, she the bride&mdash;<br />
Their flesh but not their spirits foiled.<br />
<br />
Thus was the Lady Clare debased<br />
To sack cloth and around her waist<br />
A rope the jeweled belt replaced.<br />
Her feet made free of silken hose<br />
Naked in wooden sandals cased<br />
Went bruised to Bastia's chapel, then<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>They housed her in St. Damian<br />
And here she prayed for poor women<br />
And here St. Francis sought her when<br />
His faith sank under earthly woes.<br />
<br />
Antonio cursed St. Clare in rhyme<br />
And took to wine and got the lime<br />
Of hatred on his soul, in time<br />
Grew healed though left a little lame,<br />
And laughed about it in his prime;<br />
When he could see with crystal eyes<br />
That love is a winged thing which flies;<br />
Some break the wings, some let them rise<br />
From earth like God's dove to the skies<br />
Diffused in heavenly flame.<br /></td></tr></table>

<p class="center">Would that someone would knock Mr. Bryan into a cocked
hat.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Woodrow Wilson.</span><br/></p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="5" summary="table">
<tr><td>It ain't really a hat at all, Ed:<br />
You know that, don't you?<br />
When you bowl over six out of the nine pins,<br />
And the three that are standing<br />
Are the triangular three in front,<br />
You've knocked the nine into a cocked hat.<br />
If it was really a hat, he would be knocked in, too.<br />
Which he hardly is. For a man with money,<br />
And a man who can draw a crowd to listen<br />
To what he says, ain't all-in yet....<br />
Oh yes, defeated<br />
And killed off a dozen times, but still<br />
He's one of the three nine pins that's standing ...<br />
Eh? Why, the other is Teddy, the other<br />
Wilson, we'll say. We'll see, perhaps.<br />
But six are down to make the cocked hat&mdash;<br />
That's me and thousands of others like me,<br />
And the first-rate men who were cuffed about<br />
After the Civil War,<br />
And most of the more than six million men<br />
Who followed this fellow into the ditch,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
While he walked down the ditch and stepped to the level&mdash;<br />
Following an ideal!<br />
<p><span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="spacer">*</span><span class="spacer">*</span><span class="spacer">*</span><span class="spacer">*</span></span></p>
Do you remember how slim he was,<br />
And trim he was,<br />
With black hair and pale brow,<br />
And the hawk-like nose and flashing eyes,<br />
Not turning slowly like an owl<br />
But with a sudden eagle motion?...<br />
<br />
One time, in '96, he came here<br />
And we had just a dollar and sixty cents<br />
In the treasury of the organization.<br />
So I stuck his lithograph on a pole<br />
And started out for the station.<br />
By the time we got back here to Clark street<br />
Four thousand men were marching in line,<br />
And a band that was playing for an opening<br />
Of a restaurant on Franklin street<br />
Had left the job and was following his carriage.<br />
Why, it took all the money Mark Hanna could raise<br />
To beat me, with nothing but a pole<br />
And a lithograph.<br />
And it wasn't because he was one of the prophets<br />
Come back to earth again.<br />
It shows how human hearts are hungry<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
How wonderfully true they are&mdash;<br />

Who seems to see the truth!<br />
Well, these fellows who marched are the cocked hat,<br />
And I am the cocked hat and the six millions,<br />
And more are the cocked hat,<br />
Who got themselves despised or suspected<br />
Of ignorance or something for being with him.<br />
But still, he's one of the pins that's standing.<br />
He got the money that he went after,<br />
And he has a place in history, perhaps&mdash;<br />
Because we took the blow and fell down<br />
When the ripping ball went wild on the alley.<br />
<p><span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="spacer">*</span><span class="spacer">*</span><span class="spacer">*</span><span class="spacer">*</span></span></p>
For we were radicals,<br />
And he wasn't a radical.<br />
Eh? Why, a radical stands for freedom,<br />
And for truth&mdash;which he never finds<br />
But always looks for.<br />
A radical is not a moralist.<br />
A radical doesn't say:<br />
"This is true and you must believe it;<br />
This is good and you must accept it,<br />
And if you don't believe it and accept it<br />
We'll get a law and make you,<br />
And if you don't obey the law, we'll kill you&mdash;"<br />
Oh no! A radical stands for freedom.<br />

Do you remember that banquet at the Tremont<br />
In '97 on Jackson's day?<br />
Bryan and Altgeld walked together<br />
Out to the banquet room.<br />
That's the time he said the bolters must<br />
Bring fruits meet for repentance&mdash;ha! ha! Oh, Gawd!&mdash;<br />
They never did it and they didn't have to,<br />
For they had made friends of the mammon of unrighteousness,<br />
Even as he did, a little later, in his own way.<br />
Well, Darrow was there that night.<br />
I thought it was terribly raw in him,<br />
But he said to Bryan, there, in a group:<br />
"You'd better go back to Lincoln and study<br />
Science, history, philosophy,<br />
And read Flaubert's Madam something-or-other,<br />
And quit this village religious stuff.<br />
You're head of the party before you are ready<br />
And a leader should lead with thought."<br />
And Bryan turned to the others and said:<br />
"Darrow's the only man in the world<br />
Who looks down on me for believing in God."<br />
"Your kind of a God," snapped Darrow.<br />
Honest, Ed, I didn't see this religious business<br />
In Bryan in '96 or 1900.<br />
Oh well, I knew he went to Church,<br />
And talked as statesmen do of God&mdash;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
But McKinley did it, and I used to laugh:<br />
"We've got a man to match McKinley,<br />
And it's good for us, in a squeeze like this,<br />
We didn't nominate some fellow<br />
Ethical culture or Unitarian."<br />
You see, the newspapers and preachers then<br />
Were raising such a hullabaloo<br />
About irreligion and dishonesty,<br />
And calling old Altgeld an anarchist,<br />
And comparing us to Robespierre<br />
And the guillotine boys in France.<br />
And a little of this religion came in handy.<br />
The same as if you saw a Mason button on me,<br />
You'd know, you see&mdash;but Gee!<br />
He was 24-carat religious,<br />
A cover-to-cover man....<br />
He was a trained collie,<br />
And he looked like a lion,<br />
There in the convention of '96&mdash;What do you know about that?<br />
<p><span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="spacer">*</span><span class="spacer">*</span><span class="spacer">*</span><span class="spacer">*</span></span></p>
But right here, I tell you he ain't a hypocrite,<br />
This ain't a pose. But I'll tell you:<br />
In '96 when they knocked him out,<br />
I know what he said to himself as well<br />
As if I heard him say it ...<br />
I'll tell you in a minute.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
But suppose you were giving a lecture on the constitution,<br />
And you got mixed on your dates,<br />
And the audience rotten-egged you,<br />
And some one in the confusion<br />
Stole the door receipts,<br />
And there you were, disgraced and broke!<br />
But suppose you could just change your clothes,<br />
And lecture to the same audience<br />
On the religious nature of Washington,<br />
And be applauded and make money&mdash;<br />
You'd do it, wouldn't you?<br />
Well, this is what Bill said to himself:<br />
"I'm naturally regular and religious.<br />
I'm a moral man and I can prove it<br />
By any one in Marion County,<br />
Or Jacksonville or Lincoln, Nebraska.<br />
I'm a radical, but a radical<br />
Alone can be religious.<br />
I belong to the church, if not to the bank,<br />
Of the people who defeated me.<br />
And I'll prove to religious people<br />
That I'm a man to be trusted&mdash;<br />
And just what a radical is.<br />
And I'll make some money while winning the votes<br />
Of the churches over the country."...<br />
<br />
That's it&mdash;it ain't hypocrisy,<br />
It's using what you are for ends,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
When you find yourself in trouble.<br />
And this accounts for "The Prince of Peace"&mdash;<br />
Except no one but him could write it&mdash;<br />
And "The Value of an Ideal"&mdash;<br />
(Which is money in bank and several farms) ...<br />
<br />
His place in history?<br />
One time my grandfather, who was nearly blind,<br />
Went out to sow some grass seed.<br />
They had two sacks in the barn,<br />
One with grass seed, one with fertilizer,<br />
And he got the sack with fertilizer,<br />
And scattered it over the ground,<br />
Thinking he was sowing grass.<br />
And as he was finishing up, a grandchild,<br />
Dorothy, eight years old,<br />
Followed him, dropping flower seeds.<br />
Well, after a time<br />
That was the greatest patch of weeds<br />
You ever saw! And the old man sat,<br />
Half blind, on the porch, and said:<br />
"Good land, that grass is growing!"<br />
And there was nothing but weeds except<br />
A few nasturtiums here and there<br />
That Dorothy had sown....<br />
Well, I forgot.<br />
There was a sunflower in one corner<br />
That looked like a man with a golden beard<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
And a mass of tangled, curly hair&mdash;<br />
And a pumpkin growing near it....<br />

<p class="center"><span class="huge">THE VISION</span><br/></p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="5" summary="table">
<tr><td>Of that dear vale where you and I have lain<br />
Scanning the mysteries of life and death<br />
I dreamed, though how impassable the space<br />
Of time between the present and the past!<br />
This was the vision that possessed my mind;<br />
I thought the weird and gusty days of March<br />
Had eased themselves in melody and peace.<br />
Pale lights, swift shadows, lucent stalks, clear streams,<br />
Cool, rosy eves behind the penciled mesh<br />
Of hazel thickets, and the huge feathered boughs<br />
Of walnut trees stretched singing to the blast;<br />
And the first pleasantries of sheep and kine;<br />
The cautioned twitterings of hidden birds;<br />
The flight of geese among the scattered clouds;<br />
Night's weeping stars and all the pageantries<br />
Of awakened life had blossomed into May,<br />
Whilst she with trailing violets in her hair<br />
Blew music from the stops of watery stems,<br />
And swept the grasses with her viewless robes,<br />
Which dreaming men thought voices, dreaming still.<br />
Now as I lay in vision by the stream<br />
That flows amidst our well beloved vale,<br />
I looked throughout the vista stretched between<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>Two ranging hills; one meadowed rich in grass;<br />
The other wooded, thick and quite obscure<br />
With overgrowth, rank in the luxury<br />
Of all wild places, but ever growing sparse<br />
Of trees or saplings on the sudden slope<br />
That met the grassy level of the vale;&mdash;<br />
But still within the shadow of those woods,<br />
Which sprinkled all beneath with fragrant dew,<br />
There grew all flowers, which tempted little paths<br />
Between them, up and on into the wood.<br />
Here, as the sun had left his midday peak<br />
The incommunicable blue of heaven blent<br />
With his fierce splendor, filling all the air<br />
With softened glory, while the pasturage<br />
Trembled with color of the poppy blooms<br />
Shook by the steps of the swift-sandaled wind.<br />
Nor any sound beside disturbed the dream<br />
Of Silence slumbering on the drowsy flowers.<br />
Then as I looked upon the widest space<br />
Of open meadow where the sunlight fell<br />
In veils of tempered radiance, I saw<br />
The form of one who had escaped the care<br />
And equal dullness of our common day.<br />
For like a bright mist rising from the earth<br />
He made appearance, growing more distinct<br />
Until I saw the stole, likewise the lyre<br />
Grasped by the fingers of the modeled hand.<br />
Yea, I did see the glory of his hair<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>Against the deep green bay-leaves filleting<br />
The ungathered locks. And so throughout the vale<br />
His figure stood distinct and his own shade<br />
Was the sole shadow. Deeming this approach<br />
Augur of good, as if in hidden ways<br />
Of loveliness the gods do still appear<br />
The counselors of men, and even where<br />
Wonder and meditation wooed us oft,<br />
I cried, "Apollo"&mdash;and his form dissolved,<br />
As if the nymphs of echo, who took up<br />
The voice and bore it to the hollow wood,<br />
By that same flight had startled the great god<br />
To vanishment. And thereupon I woke<br />
And disarrayed the figment of my thought.<br />
For of the very air, magic with hues,<br />
Blent with the distant objects, I had formed<br />
The splendid apparition, and so knew<br />
It was, alas! a dream within a dream!<br /></td></tr></table>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="5" summary="table">
<tr><td><span style="margin-left: 3em;">Reading over your letters I find you wrote me</span><br />
"My dear boy," or at times "dear boy," and the envelope<br />
Said "master"&mdash;all as I had been your very son,<br />
And not the orphan whom you adopted.<br />
Well, you were father to me! And I can recall<br />
The things you did for me or gave me:<br />
One time we rode in a box car to Springfield<br />
To see the greatest show on earth;<br />
And one time you gave me redtop boots,<br />
And one time a watch, and one time a gun.<br />
Well, I grew to gawkiness with a voice<br />
Like a rooster trying to crow in August<br />
Hatched in April, we'll say.<br />
And you went about wrapped up in silence<br />
With eyes aflame, and I heard little rumors<br />
Of what they were doing to you, and how<br />
They wronged you&mdash;and we were poor&mdash;so poor!<br />
And I could not understand why you failed,<br />
And why if you did good things for the people<br />
The people did not sustain you.<br />
And why you loved another woman than Aunt Susan,<br />
So it was whispered at school, and what could be baser,<br />
Or so little to be forgiven?...<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">They crowded you hard in those days.</span><br />
But you fought like a wounded lion<br />
For yourself I know, but for us, for me.<br />
At last you fell ill, and for months you tottered<br />
Around the streets as thin as death,<br />
Trying to earn our bread, your great eyes glowing<br />
And the silence around you like a shawl!<br />
But something in you kept you up.<br />
You grew well again and rosy with cheeks<br />
Like an Indian peach almost, and eyes<br />
Full of moonlight and sunlight, and a voice<br />
That sang, and a humor that warded<br />
The arrows off. But still between us<br />
There was reticence; you kept me away<br />
With a glittering hardness; perhaps you thought<br />
I kept you away&mdash;for I was moving<br />
In spheres you knew not, living through<br />
Beliefs you believed in no more, and ideals<br />
That were just mirrors of unrealities.<br />
As a boy can be I was critical of you.<br />
And reasons for your failures began to arise<br />
In my mind&mdash;I saw specific facts here and there<br />
With no philosophy at hand to weld them<br />
And synthesize them into one truth&mdash;<br />
And a rush of the strength of youth<br />
Deluded me into thinking the world<br />
Was something so easily understood and managed<br />
While I knew it not at all in truth.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
And an adolescent egotism<br />
Made me feel you did not know me<br />
Or comprehend the all that I was.<br />
All this you divined....<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">So it went. And when I left you and passed</span><br />
To the world, the city&mdash;still I see you<br />
With eyes averted, and feel your hand<br />
Limp with sorrow&mdash;you could not speak.<br />
You thought of what I might be, and where<br />
Life would take me, and how it would end&mdash;<br />
There was longer silence. A year or two<br />
Brought me closer to you. I saw the play now<br />
And the game somewhat and understood your fights<br />
And enmities, and hardnesses and silences,<br />
And wild humor that had kept you whole&mdash;<br />
For your soul had made it as an antitoxin<br />
To the world's infections. And you swung to me<br />
Closer than before&mdash;and a chumship began<br />
Between us....<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 7em;">What vital power was yours!</span><br />
You never tired, or needed sleep, or had a pain,<br />
Or refused a delight. I loved the things now<br />
You had always loved, a winning horse,<br />
A roulette wheel, a contest of skill<br />
In games or sports ... long talks on the corner<br />
With men who have lived and tell you<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>Things with a rich flavor of old wisdom or humor;<br />
A woman, a glass of whisky at a table<br />
Where the fatigue of life falls, and our reserves<br />
That wait for happiness come up in smiles,<br />
Laughter, gentle confidences. Here you were<br />
A man with youth, and I a youth was a man,<br />
Exulting in your braveries and delight in life.<br />
How you knocked that scamp over at Harry Varnell's<br />
When he tried to take your chips! And how I,<br />
Who had thought the devil in cards as a boy,<br />
Loved to play with you now and watch you play;<br />
And watch the subtle mathematics of your mind<br />
Prophecy, divine the plays. Who was it<br />
In your ancestry that you harked back to<br />
And reproduced with such various gifts<br />
Of flesh and spirit, Anglo-Saxon, Celt?&mdash;<br />
You with such rapid wit and powerful skill<br />
For catching illogic and whipping Error's<br />
Fangéd head from the body?...<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 7em;">I was really ahead of you</span><br />
At this stage, with more self-consciousness<br />
Of what man is, and what life is at last,<br />
And how the spirit works, and by what laws,<br />
With what inevitable force. But still I was<br />
Behind you in that strength which in our youth,<br />
If ever we have it, squeezes all the nectar<br />
From the grapes. It seemed you'd never lose<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
This power and sense of joy, but yet at times<br />
I saw another phase of you....<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">There was the day</span><br />
We rode together north of the old town,<br />
Past the old farm houses that I knew&mdash;<br />
Past maple groves, and fields of corn in the shock,<br />
And fields of wheat with the fall green.<br />
It was October, but the clouds were summer's,<br />
Lazily floating in a sky of June;<br />
And a few crows flying here and there,<br />
And a quail's call, and around us a great silence<br />
That held at its core old memories<br />
Of pioneers, and dead days, forgotten things!<br />
I'll never forget how you looked that day. Your hair<br />
Was turning silver now, but still your eyes<br />
Burned as of old, and the rich olive glow<br />
In your cheeks shone, with not a line or wrinkle!&mdash;<br />
You seemed to me perfection&mdash;a youth, a man!<br />
And now you talked of the world with the old wit,<br />
And now of the soul&mdash;how such a man went down<br />
Through folly or wrong done by him, and how<br />
Man's death cannot end all,<br />
There must be life hereafter!...<br />
<br />
As you were that day, as you looked and spoke,<br />
As the earth was, I hear as the soul of it all<br />
Godard's <i>Dawn</i>, Dvorák's <i>Humoresque</i>,<br />
The Morris Dances, Mendelssohn's <i>Barcarole</i>,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
And old Scotch songs, <i>When the Kye Come Hame</i>,<br />
And <i>The Moon Had Climbed the Highest Hill</i>,<br />
The Musseta Waltz and Rudolph's Narrative;<br />
Your great brow seemed Beethoven's<br />
And the lust of life in your face Cellini's,<br />
And your riotous fancy like Dumas.<br />
I was nearer you now than ever before,<br />
And finding each other thus I see to-day<br />
How the human soul seeks the human soul<br />
And finds the one it seeks at last.<br />
For you know you can open a window<br />
That looks upon embowered darkness,<br />
When the flowers sleep and the trees are still<br />
At Midnight, and no light burns in the room;<br />
And you can hide your butterfly<br />
Somewhere in the room, but soon you will see<br />
A host of butterfly mates<br />
Fluttering through the window to join<br />
Your butterfly hid in the room.<br />
It is somehow thus with souls....<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">This day then I understood it all:</span><br />
Your vital democracy and love of men<br />
And tolerance of life; and how the excess of these<br />
Had wrought your sorrows in the days<br />
When we were so poor, and the small of mind<br />
Spoke of your sins and your connivance<br />
With sinful men. You had lived it down,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
Had triumphed over them, and you had grown.<br />
Prosperous in the world and had passed<br />
Into an easy mastery of life and beyond the thought<br />
Of further conquests for things.<br />
As the Brahmins say, no more you worshiped matter,<br />
Or scarcely ghosts, or even the gods<br />
With singleness of heart.<br />
This day you worshiped Eternal Peace<br />
Or Eternal Flame, with scarce a laugh or jest<br />
To hide your worship; and I understood,<br />
Seeing so many facets to you, why it was<br />
Blind Condon always smiled to hear your voice,<br />
And why it was in a greenroom years ago<br />
Booth turned to you, marking your face<br />
From all the rest, and said, "There is a man<br />
Who might play Hamlet&mdash;better still Othello";<br />
And why it was the women loved you; and the priest<br />
Could feed his body and soul together drinking<br />
A glass of beer and visiting with you....<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 7em;">Then something happened:</span><br />
Your face grew smaller, your brow more narrow,<br />
Dull fires burned in your eyes,<br />
Your body shriveled, you walked with a cynical shuffle,<br />
Your hands mixed the keys of life,<br />
You had become a discord.<br />
A monstrous hatred consumed you&mdash;<br />
You had suffered the greatest wrong of all,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
I knew and granted the wrong.<br />
You had mounted up to sixty years, now breathing hard,<br />
And just at the time that honor belonged to you<br />
You were dishonored at the hands of a friend.<br />
I wept for you, and still I wondered<br />
If all I had grown to see in you and find in you<br />
And love in you was just a fond illusion&mdash;<br />
If after all I had not seen you aright as a boy:<br />
Barbaric, hard, suspicious, cruel, redeemed<br />
Alone by bubbling animal spirits&mdash;<br />
Even these gone now, all of you smoke<br />
Laden with stinging gas and lethal vapor....<br />
Then you came forth again like the sun after storm&mdash;<br />
The deadly uric acid driven out at last<br />
Which had poisoned you and dwarfed your soul&mdash;<br />
So much for soul!<br />
<br />
The last time I saw you<br />
Your face was full of golden light,<br />
Something between flame and the richness of flesh.<br />
You were yourself again, wholly yourself.<br />
And oh, to find you again and resume<br />
Our understanding we had worked so long to reach&mdash;<br />
You calm and luminant and rich in thought!<br />
This time it seemed we said but "yes" or "no"&mdash;<br />
That was enough; we smoked together<br />
And drank a glass of wine and watched<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
The leaves fall sitting on the porch....<br />
Then life whirled me away like a leaf,<br />
And I went about the crowded ways of New York.<br />
<br />
And one night Alberta and I took dinner<br />
At a place near Fourteenth Street where the music<br />
Was like the sun on a breeze-swept lake<br />
When every wave is a patine of fire,<br />
And I thought of you not at all<br />
Looking at Alberta and watching her white teeth<br />
Bite off bits of Italian bread,<br />
And watching her smile and the wide pupils<br />
Of her eyes, electrified by wine<br />
And music and the touch of our hands<br />
Now and then across the table.<br />
We went to her house at last.<br />
And through a languorous evening.<br />
Where no light was but a single candle,<br />
We circled about and about a pending theme<br />
Till at last we solved it suddenly in rapture<br />
Almost by chance; and when I left<br />
She followed me to the hall and leaned above<br />
The railing about the stair for the farewell kiss&mdash;<br />
And I went into the open air ecstatically,<br />
With the stars in the spaces of sky between<br />
The towering buildings, and the rush<br />
Of wheels and clang of bells,<br />
Still with the fragrance of her lips and cheeks<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
And glinting hair about me, delicate<br />
And keen in spite of the open air.<br />
And just as I entered the brilliant car<br />
Something said to me you are dead&mdash;<br />
I had not thought of you, was not thinking of you.<br />
But I knew it was true, as it was,<br />
For the telegram waited me at my room....<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">I didn't come back.</span><br />
I could not bear to see the breathless breath<br />
Over your brow&mdash;nor look at your face&mdash;<br />
However you fared or where<br />
To what victories soever&mdash;<br />
Vanquished or seemingly vanquished!<br /></td></tr></table>

Down in the loop the blue-gray air enshrouds,<br />
As with a cyclops' cape, the man-made hills<br />
And towers of granite where the city crowds.<br />
Above the din a copper's whistle shrills.<br />
There is a smell of coffee and of spices.<br />
We near the market place of trade's devices.<br />
Blue smoke from out a roasting room is pouring.<br />
A rooster crows, geese cackle, men are bawling.<br />
Whips crack, trucks creak, it is the place of storing,<br />
And drawing out and loading up and hauling<br />
Fruit, vegetables and fowls and steaks and hams,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
Oysters and lobsters, fish and crabs and clams.<br />
And near at hand are restaurants and bars,<br />
Hotels with rooms at fifty cents a day,<br />
Beer tunnels, pool rooms, places where cigars<br />
And cigarettes their window signs display;<br />
Mixed in with letterings of printed tags,<br />
Twine, boxes, cartels, sacks and leather bags,<br />
Wigs, telescopes, eyeglasses, ladies' tresses,<br />
Or those who manicure or fashion dresses,<br />
Or sell us putters, tennis balls or brassies,<br />
Make shoes, pull teeth, or fit the eye with glasses.<br />
<br />
And now the rows of windows showing laces,<br />
Silks, draperies and furs and costly vases,<br />
Watches and mirrors, silver cups and mugs,<br />
Emeralds, diamonds, Indian, Persian rugs,<br />
Hats, velvets, silver buckles, ostrich-plumes,<br />
Drugs, violet water, powder and perfumes.<br />
Here is a monstrous winking eye&mdash;beneath<br />
A showcase by an entrance full of teeth.<br />
Here rubber coats, umbrellas, mackintoshes,<br />
Hoods, rubber boots and arctics and galoshes.<br />
Here is half a block of overcoats,<br />
In this bleak time of snow and slender throats.<br />
Then windows of fine linen, snakewood canes,<br />
Scarfs, opera hats, in use where fashion reigns.<br />
As when the hive swarms, so the crowded street<br />
Roars to the shuffling of innumerable feet.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
Skyscrapers soar above them; they go by<br />
As bees crawl, little scales upon the skin<br />
Of a great dragon winding out and in.<br />
Above them hangs a tangled tree of signs,<br />
Suspended or uplifted like dædalian<br />
Hieroglyphics when the saturnalian<br />
Night commences, and their racing lines<br />
Run fire of blue and yellow in a puzzle,<br />
Bewildering to the eyes of those who guzzle,<br />
And gourmandize and stroll and seek the bubble<br />
Of happiness to put away their trouble.<br />
<br />
Around the loop the elevated crawls,<br />
And giant shadows sink against the walls<br />
Where ten to twenty stories strive to hold<br />
The pale refraction of the sunset's gold.<br />
Slop underfoot, we pass beneath the loop.<br />
The crowd is uglier, poorer; there are smells<br />
As from the depths of unsuspected hells,<br />
And from a groggery where beer and soup<br />
Are sold for five cents to the thieves and bums.<br />
Here now are huge cartoons in red and blue<br />
Of obese women and of skeleton men,<br />
Egyptian dancers, twined with monstrous snakes,<br />
Before the door a turbaned lithe Hindoo,<br />
A bagpipe shrilling, underneath a den<br />
Of opium, whence a man with hand that shakes,<br />
Rolling a cigarette, so palely comes.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
The clang of car bells and the beat of drums.<br />
Draft horses clamping with their steel-shod hoofs.<br />
The buildings have grown small and black and worn;<br />
The sky is more beholden; o'er the roofs<br />
A flock of pigeons soars; with dresses torn<br />
And yellow faces, labor women pass<br />
Some Chinese gabbling; and there, buying fruit,<br />
Stands a fair girl who is a late recruit<br />
To those poor women slain each year by lust.<br />
'Tis evening now and trade will soon begin.<br />
The family entrance beckons for a glass<br />
Of hopeful mockery, the piano's din<br />
Into the street with sounds of rasping wires<br />
Filters, and near a pawner's window shows<br />
Pistols, accordions; and, luring buyers,<br />
A Jew stands mumbling to the passer-by<br />
Of jewelry and watches and old clothes.<br />
A limousine gleams quickly&mdash;with a cry<br />
A legless man fastened upon a board<br />
With casters 'neath it by a sudden shove<br />
Darts out of danger. And upon the corner<br />
A lassie tells a man that God is love,<br />
Holding a tambourine with its copper hoard<br />
To be augmented by the drunken scorner.<br />
A woman with no eyeballs in her sockets<br />
Plays "Rock of Ages" on a wheezy organ.<br />
A newsboy with cold hands thrust in his pockets<br />
Cries, "All about the will of Pierpont Morgan!"<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
The roofline of the street now sinks and dwindles.<br />
The windows are begrimed with dust and beer.<br />
A child half clothed, with legs as thin as spindles,<br />
Carries a basket with some bits of coal.<br />
Between lace curtains eyes of yellow leer,<br />
The cheeks splotched with white places like the skin<br />
Inside an eggshell&mdash;destitute of soul.<br />
One sees a brass lamp oozing kerosene<br />
Upon a stand whereon her elbows lean;<br />
Lighted, it soon will welcome negroes in.<br />
<br />
The railroad tracks are near. We almost choke<br />
From filth whirled from the street and stinging vapors.<br />
Great engines vomit gas and heavy smoke<br />
Upon a north wind driving tattered papers,<br />
Dry dung and dust and refuse down the street.<br />
A circumambient roar as of a wheel<br />
Whirring far off&mdash;a monster's heart whose beat<br />
Is full of murmurs, comes as we retreat<br />
Towards Twenty-second. And a man with jaw<br />
Set like a tiger's, with a dirty beard,<br />
Skulks toward the loop, with heavy wrists red-raw<br />
Glowing above his pockets where his hands<br />
Pushed tensely round his hips the coat tails draw,<br />
And show what seems a slender piece of metal<br />
In his hip pocket. On these barren strands<br />
He waits for midnight for old scores to settle<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
Against his ancient foe society,<br />
Who keeps the soup house and who builds the jails.<br />
Switchmen and firemen with their dinner pails<br />
Go by him homeward, and he wonders if<br />
These fellows know a hundred thousand workers<br />
Walk up and down the city's highways, stiff<br />
From cold and hunger, doomed to poverty,<br />
As wretched as the thieves and crooks and shirkers.<br />
He scurries to the lake front, loiters past<br />
The windows of wax lights with scarlet shades,<br />
Where smiling diners back of ambuscades<br />
Of silk and velvet hear not winter's blast<br />
Blowing across the lake. He has a thought<br />
Of Michigan, where once at picking berries<br />
He spent a summer&mdash;then his eye is caught<br />
At Randolph street by written light which tarries,<br />
Then like a film runs into sentences.<br />
He sees it all as from a black abyss.<br />
Taxis with skid chains rattle, limousines<br />
Draw up to awnings; for a space he catches<br />
A scent of musk or violets, sees the patches<br />
On powdered cheeks of furred and jeweled queens.<br />
The color round his cruel mouth grows whiter,<br />
He thrusts his coarse hands in his pockets tighter:<br />
He is a thief, he knows he is a thief,<br />
He is a thief found out, and, as he knows,<br />
The whole loop is a kingdom held in fief<br />
By men who work with laws instead of blows<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
From sling shots, so he curses under breath<br />
The money and the invisible hand that owns<br />
From year to year, in spite of change and death,<br />
The wires for the lights and telephones,<br />
The railways on the streets, and overhead<br />
The railways, and beneath the winding tunnel<br />
Which crooks stole from the city for a runnel<br />
To drain her nickels; and the pipes of lead<br />
Which carry gas, wrapped round us like a snake,<br />
And round the courts, whose grip no court can break.<br />
He curses bitterly all those who rise,<br />
And rule by just the spirit which he plies<br />
Coarsely against the world's great store of wealth;<br />
Bankers and usurers and cliques whose stealth<br />
Works witchcraft through the market and the press,<br />
And hires editors, or owns the stock<br />
Controlling papers, playing with finesse<br />
The city's thinking, that they may unlock<br />
Treasures and powers like burglars in the dark.<br />
And thinking thus and cursing, through a flurry<br />
Of sudden snow he hastens on to Clark.<br />
In a cheap room there is an eye to mark<br />
His coming and be glad. His footsteps hurry.<br />
She will have money, earned this afternoon<br />
Through men who took her from a near saloon<br />
Wherein she sits at table to dragoon<br />
Roughnecks or simpletons upon a lark.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
Within a little hall a fierce-eyed youth<br />
Rants of the burdens on the people's backs&mdash;<br />
He would cure all things with the single tax.<br />
A clergyman demands more gospel truth,<br />
Speaking to Christians at a weekly dinner.<br />
A parlor Marxian, for a beginner<br />
Would take the railways. And amid applause<br />
Where lawyers dine, a judge says all will be<br />
Well if we hand down to posterity<br />
Respect for courts and judges and the laws.<br />
An anarchist would fight. Upon the whole,<br />
Another thinks, to cultivate one's soul<br />
Is most important&mdash;let the passing show<br />
Go where it wills, and where it wills to go.<br />
<br />
Outside the stars look down. Stars are content<br />
To be so quiet and indifferent.<br /></td></tr></table>

As we thought for a little while,<br />
Alone in the car, in the corner<br />
Around the turn of the aisle.<br />
<br />
A quiver came in your voice,<br />
Your eyes were sorrowful too;<br />
'Twas over&mdash;I strode to the doorway,<br />
Then turned to wave an adieu.<br />
<br />
But you had not come from the corner,<br />
And though I had gone so far,<br />
I retraced, and faced you coming<br />
Into the aisle of the car.<br />
<br />
You stopped as one who was caught<br />
In an evil mood by surprise.&mdash;<br />
I want to forget, I am trying<br />
To forget the look in your eyes.<br />
<br />
Your face was blank and cold,<br />
Like Lot's wife turned to salt.<br />
I suddenly trapped and discovered<br />
Your soul in a hidden fault.<br />
<br />

And your wide eyes looked on me<br />
Like a Mænad musing murder,<br />
Or the mask of Melpomene.<br />
<br />
And there in a flash of lightning<br />
I learned what I never could prove:<br />
That your heart contained no sorrow,<br />
And your heart contained no love.<br />

And my heart is light and heavy,<br />
And this is the reason why:<br />
I am glad we parted forever,<br />

You leaned and were blest&mdash;<br />
And none except Judas and you broke the faith<br />
To the day of His death,&mdash;<br />
You, Peter, the fisherman, worthy of blame,<br />
Arise to this fame?<br />
<br />
'Twas you in the garden who fell into sleep<br />
And the watch failed to keep,<br />
When Jesus was praying and pressed with the weight<br />
Of the oncoming fate.<br />
'Twas you in the court of the palace who warmed<br />
Your hands as you stormed<br />
At the damsel, denying Him thrice, when she cried:<br />
"He walked at his side!"<br />
You, Peter, a wave, a star among clouds, a reed in the wind,<br />
A guide of the blind,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
Both smiter and flyer, but human alway, I protest,<br />
Beyond all the rest.<br />
<br />
When at night by the boat on the sea He appeared<br />
Did you wait till he neared?<br />
You leaped in the water, not dreading the worst<br />
In your joy to be first<br />
To greet Him and tell Him of all that had passed<br />
Since you saw Him the last.<br />
You had slept while He watched, but fierce were you, fierce and awake<br />
When they sought Him to take,<br />
And cursing, no doubt, as you smote off, as one of the least,<br />
The ear of the priest.<br />
Then Andrew and all of them fled, but you followed Him, hoping for strength<br />
To save him at length<br />
Till you lied to the damsel, oh penitent Peter, and crept,<br />
Into hiding and wept.<br />
<br />
Oh well! But he asked all the twelve, "Who am I?"<br />
And who made reply?<br />
As you leaped in the sea, so you spoke as you smote with the sword;<br />
"Thou art Christ, even Lord!"<br />
John leaned on His breast, but he asked you, your strength to foresee,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
"Nay, lovest thou me?"<br />
Thrice over, as thrice you denied Him, and chose you to lead<br />
His sheep and to feed;<br />
And gave you, He said, the keys of the den and the fold<br />
To have and to hold.<br />
You were a poor jailer, oh Peter, the dreamer, who saw<br />
The death of the law<br />
In the dream of the vessel that held all the four-footed beasts,<br />
Unclean for the priests;<br />
And heard in the vision a trumpet that all men are worth<br />
The peace of the earth<br />
And rapture of heaven hereafter,&mdash;oh Peter, what power<br />
Was yours in that hour:<br />
You warder and jailer and sealer of fates and decrees,<br />
To use the big keys<br />
With which to reveal and fling wide all the soul and the scheme<br />
Of the Galilee dream,<br />
When you flashed in a trice, as later you smote with the sword:<br />
"Thou art Christ, even Lord!"<br />

Of steel upon rock.<br />

<tr><td>His father had a large family<br />
Of girls and boys and he was born and bred<br />
In a barn or kind of cattle shed.<br />
But he was a hardy youngster and grew to be<br />
A boy with eyes that sparkled like a rod<br />
Of white hot iron in the blacksmith shop.<br />
His face was ruddy like a rising moon,<br />
And his hair was black as sheep's wool that is black.<br />
And he had rugged arms and legs and a strong back.<br />
And he had a voice half flute and half bassoon.<br />
And from his toes up to his head's top<br />
He was a man, simple but intricate.<br />
And most men differ who try to delineate<br />
His life and fate.<br />
<br />
He never seemed ashamed<br />
Of poverty or of his origin. He was a wayward child,<br />
Nevertheless though wise and mild,<br />
And thoughtful but when angered then he flamed<br />
As fire does in a forge.<br />
When he was ten years old he ran away<br />
To be alone and watch the sea, and the stars<br />
At midnight from a mountain gorge.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span><br />
When he returned his parents scolded him<br />
And threatened him with bolts and bars.<br />
Then they grew soft for his return and gay<br />
And with their love would have enfolded him.<br />
But even at ten years old he had a way<br />
Of gazing at you with a look austere<br />
Which gave his kinfolk fear.<br />
He had no childlike love for father or mother,<br />
Sister or brother,<br />
They were the same to him as any other.<br />
He was a little cold, a little queer.<br />
<br />
His father was a laborer and now<br />
They made the boy work for his daily bread.<br />
They say he read<br />
A book or two during these years of work.<br />
But if there was a secret prone to lurk<br />
Between the pages under the light of his brow<br />
It came forth. And if he had a woman<br />
In love or out of love, or a companion or a chum,<br />
History is dumb.<br />
So far as we know he dreamed and worked with hands<br />
And learned to know his genius' commands<br />
Or what is called one's dæmon.<br />
<br />
And this became at last the city's call.<br />
He had now reached the age of thirty years,<br />
And found a Dream of Life and a solution<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
For slavery of soul and even all<br />
Miseries that flow from things material.<br />
To free the world was his soul's resolution.<br />
But his family had great fears<br />
For him, knowing the evil<br />
Which might befall him, seeing that the light<br />
Of his own dream had blinded his mind's eyes.<br />
They could not tell but what he had a devil.<br />
But still in their tears despite,<br />
And warnings he departed with replies<br />
That when a man's genius calls him<br />
He must obey no matter what befalls him.<br />
<br />
What he had in his mind was growth<br />
Of soul by watching,<br />
And the creation of eyes<br />
Over your mind's eyes to supervise<br />
A clear activity and to ward off sloth.<br />
What he had in his mind was scotching<br />
And killing the snake of Hatred and stripping the glove<br />
From the hand of Hypocrisy and quenching the fire<br />
Of Falsehood and Unbrotherly Desire.&mdash;<br />
What he had in his mind was simply Love.<br />
And it was strange he preached the sword and force<br />
To establish Love, but it was not strange,<br />
Since he did this, his life took on a change.<br />
And what he taught seems muddled at its source<br />
With moralizing and with moral strife.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
For morals are merely the Truth diluted<br />
And sweetened up and suited<br />
To the business and bread of Life.<br />
<br />
And now this City was just what you'd find<br />
A city anywhere,<br />
A turmoil and a Vanity Fair,<br />
A sort of heaven and a sort of Tophet.<br />
There were so many leaders of his kind<br />
The city didn't care<br />
For one additional prophet.<br />
He said some extravagant things<br />
And planted a few stings<br />
Under the rich man's hide.<br />
And one of the sensational newspapers<br />
Gave him a line or two for cutting capers<br />
In front of the Palace of Justice and the Church.<br />
But all of the first grade people took the other side<br />
Of the street when they saw him coming<br />
With a rag tag crowd singing and humming,<br />
And curious boys and men up in a perch<br />
Of a tree or window taking the spectacle in,<br />
And the Corybantic din<br />
Of a Salvation Army as it were.<br />
And whatever he dreamed when he lived in a little town<br />
The intelligent people ignored him, and this is the stir<br />
And the only stir he made in the city.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
But there was a certain sinister<br />
Fellow who came to him hearing of his renown<br />
And said "You can be Mayor of this city,<br />
We need a man like you for Mayor."<br />
And others said "You'd make a lawyer or a politician,<br />
Look how the people follow you;<br />
Why don't you hire out as a special writer,<br />
You could become a business man, a rhetorician,<br />
You could become a player,<br />
You can grow rich. There's nothing for a fighter,<br />
Fighting as you are, but to end in ruin."<br />
But he turned from them on his way pursuing<br />
The dream he had in view.<br />
<br />
He had a rich man or two<br />
Who took up with him against the powerful frown<br />
Which looked him down.<br />
For you'll always find a rich man or two<br />
To take up with anything.<br />
There are those who can't get into society or bring<br />
Their riches to a social recognition;<br />
Or ill-formed souls who lack the real patrician<br />
Spirit for life.<br />
But as for him he didn't care, he passed<br />
Where the richness of living was rife.<br />
And like wise Goethe talking to the last<br />
With cabmen rather than with lords<br />
He sat about the markets and the fountains,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
He walked about the country and the mountains,<br />
Took trips upon the lakes and waded fords<br />
Barefooted, laughing as a young animal<br />
Disports itself amid the festival<br />
Of warm winds, sunshine, summer's carnival&mdash;<br />
With laborers, carpenters, seamen<br />
And some loose women.<br />
And certain notable sinners<br />
Gave him dinners.<br />
And he went to weddings and to places where youth slakes<br />
Its thirst for happiness, and they served him cakes<br />
And wine wherever he went.<br />
And he ate and drank and spent<br />
His time in feasting and in telling stories,<br />
And singing poems of lilies and of trees,<br />
With crowds of people crowded around his knees<br />
That searched with lightning secrets hidden<br />
Of life and of life's glories,<br />
Of death and of the soul's way after death.<br />
<br />
Time makes amends usually for scandal's breath,<br />
Which touched him to his earthly ruination.<br />
But this city had a Civic Federation,<br />
And a certain social order which intrigues<br />
Through churches, courts, with an endless ramification<br />
Of money and morals to save itself.<br />
And this city had a Bar Association,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
Also its Public Efficiency Leagues<br />
For laying honest men upon the shelf<br />
While making private pelf<br />
Secure and free to increase.<br />
And this city had illustrious Pharisees<br />
And this city had a legion<br />
Of men who make a business of religion,<br />
With eyes one inch apart,<br />
Dark and narrow of heart,<br />
Who give themselves and give the city no peace,<br />
And who are everywhere the best police<br />
For Life as business.<br />
And when they saw this youth<br />
Was telling the truth,<br />
And that his followers were multiplying,<br />
And were going about rejoicing and defying<br />
The social order and were stirring up<br />
The dregs of discontent in the cup<br />
With the hand of their own happiness,<br />
They saw dynamic mysteries<br />
In the poems of lilies and trees,<br />
Therefore they held him for a felony.<br />
<br />
If you will take a kernel of wheat<br />
And first make free<br />
The outer flake and then pare off the meat<br />
Of edible starch you'll find at the kernel's core<br />
The life germ. And this young man's words were dim<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
With blasphemy, sedition at the rim,<br />
Which fired the heads of dreamers like new wine.<br />
But this was just the outward force of him.<br />
For this young man's philosophy was more<br />
Than such external ferment, being divine<br />
With secrets so profound no plummet line<br />

A clear activity and to ward off sloth.<br />
What he had in mind was scotching<br />
And killing the snake of Hatred and stripping the glove<br />
From the hand of Hypocrisy and quenching the fire<br />
Of falsehood and unbrotherly Desire.<br />
What he had in mind was simply Love.<br />
<br />
But he was prosecuted<br />
As a rebel and as a rebel executed<br />
Right in a public place where all could see.<br />
And his mother watched him hang for the felony.<br />
He hated to die being but thirty-three,<br />
And fearing that his poems might be lost.<br />
And certain members of the Bar Association,<br />
And of the Civic Federation,<br />
And of the League of Public Efficiency,<br />
And a legion<br />

And hooted at him giving up the ghost<br />
In great despair and with a fearful cry!<br />

And after him there was a man named Paul<br />
Who almost spoiled it all.<br />
<br />
And protozoan things like hypocrites,<br />
And parasitic things who make a food<br />
Of the mysteries of God for earthly power<br />
Must wonder how before this young man's hour<br />
They lived without his blood,<br />
Shed on that day, and which<br />
In red cells is so rich.<br /></td></tr></table>

He cared not whether the morning dawned,<br />
The brother of Eos and the Moon<br />
Stretched him and rubbed his eyes.<br />
<br />
He would have dreamed the dream again<br />
That found him under sea:<br />
He saw Zeus sit by Hera's side,<br />
He saw Hæphestos with his bride;<br />
He traced from Enna's flowery plain<br />
The child Persephone.<br />
<br />
There was a time when heaven's vault<br />
Cracked like a temple's roof.<br />
A new hierarchy burst its shell,<br />
And as the sapphire ceiling fell,<br />
From stern Jehovah's mad assault,<br />
Vast spaces stretched aloof:<br />
<br />
Great blue black depths of frozen air<br />
Engulfed the soul of Zeus.<br />
And then Jehovah reigned instead.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>

Far off in the waste empyrean<br />
The world was a golden mote.<br />
And the Sun hung like a red balloon,<br />
Or a bomb afire o'er a barracoon.<br />
And the sea was drab, and the sea was green<br />
Like a many colored coat.<br />
<br />
The sea was pink like cyclamen,<br />
And red as a blushing rose.<br />
It shook anon like the sensitive plant,<br />
Under the golden light aslant.<br />
The little waves patted the shore again<br />
Where the restless river flows.<br />
<br />
And thus it has been for ages gone&mdash;<br />
For a hundred thousand years;<br />
Ere Buddha lived or Jesus came,<br />
Or ever the city had place or name,<br />
The sea thrilled through at the kiss of dawn<br />
Like a soul of smiles and tears.<br />
<br />
When the city's seat was a waste of sand,<br />
And the hydra lived alone,<br />
The sound of the sea was here to be heard,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
And the moon rose up like a great white bird,<br />
Sailing aloft from the yellow strand<br />
To her silent midnight throne.<br />
<br />
Now Helios eyes the universe,<br />
And he knows the world is small.<br />
Of old he walked through pagan Tyre,<br />
Babylon, Sodom destroyed by fire,<br />
And sought to unriddle the primal curse<br />
That holds the race in thrall.<br />
<br />
So he stepped from the Sun in robes of flame<br />
As the city woke from sleep.<br />
He walked the markets, walked the squares,<br />
He walked the places of sweets and snares,<br />
Where men buy honor and barter shame,<br />
And the weak are killed as sheep.<br />
<br />
He saw the city is one great mart<br />
Where life is bought and sold.<br />
Men rise to get them meat and bread<br />
To barter for drugs or coffin the dead.<br />
And dawn is but a plucked-up heart<br />
For the dreary game of gold.<br />
<br />
"Ho! ho!" said Helios, "father Zeus<br />
Would never botch it so.<br />
If he had stolen Joseph's bride,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
And let his son be crucified<br />
The son's blood had been put to use<br />
To ease the people's woe."<br />
<br />
"He of the pest and the burning bush,<br />
Of locusts, lice, and frogs,<br />
Who made me stand, veiling my light,<br />
While Joshua slaughtered the Amorite,<br />
Who blacked the skin of the sons of Cush,<br />
And builded the synagogues."<br />
<br />
"And Jehovah the great is omnipotent,<br />
While Zeus was bound by Fate.<br />
But Athens fell when Peter took Rome,<br />
And Chicago is made His hecatomb.<br />
And since from the hour His son was sent<br />
The hypocrite holds the state."<br />
<br />
Helios traversed the city streets<br />
And this is what he saw:<br />
Some sold their honor, some their skill,<br />
The soldier hired himself to kill,<br />
The judges bartered the judgment seats<br />
And trafficked in the law.<br />
<br />
The starving artist sold his youth,<br />
The writer sold his pen;<br />
The lawyer sharpened up his wits<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
Like a burglar filing auger bits,<br />
And Jesus' vicar sold the truth<br />
To the famished sons of men.<br />
<br />
In every heart flamed cruelty<br />
Like a little emerald snake.<br />
And each one knew if he should stand<br />
In another's way the dagger-hand<br />
Would make the stronger the feofee<br />
Of the coveted wapentake.<br />
<br />
There's not a thing men will not do<br />
For honor, gold, or power.<br />
We smile and call the city fair,<br />
We call life lovely and debonair,<br />
But Proserpina never grew<br />
So deadly a passion flower.<br />
<br />
Go live for an hour in a tropic land<br />
Hid near a sinking pool:<br />
The lion and tiger come to drink,<br />
The boa crawls to the water's brink,<br />
The elephant bull kneels down in the sand<br />
And drinks till his throat is cool.<br />
<br />
Jehovah will keep you awhile unseen<br />
As you lie behind the rocks.<br />
But go, if you dare, to slake your thirst,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
Though Jesus died for our life accursed<br />
Your bones by the tiger will be licked clean<br />
As he licks the bones of an ox.<br />
<br />
And the sky may be blue as fleur de lis,<br />
And the earth be tulip red;<br />
And God in heaven, and life all good<br />
While you lie hid in the underwood:<br />
And the city may leave you sorrow free<br />
If you ask it not for bread.<br />
<br />
One day Achilles lost a horse<br />
While the pest at Troy was rife,<br />
And a million maggots fought and ate<br />
Like soldiers storming a city's gate,<br />
And Thersites said, as he looked at the corse,<br />
"Achilles, that is life."
<p><span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="spacer">*</span><span class="spacer">*</span><span class="spacer">*</span><span class="spacer">*</span></span></p>
Day fades and from a million cells<br />
The office people pour.<br />
Like bees that crawl on the honeycomb<br />
The workers scurry to what is home,<br />
And trains and traffic and clanging bells<br />
Make the cañon highways roar.<br />
<br />
Helios walked the city's ways<br />
Till the lights began to shine.<br />
Then the janitor women start to scrub<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
And the Pharisees up and enter the club,<br />
And the harlot wakes, and the music plays<br />
And the glasses glow with wine.<br />
<br />
Now we're good fellows one and all,<br />
And the buffet storms with talk.<br />
"The market's closed and trade's at end<br />
We had our battle, now I'm your friend."<br />
And thanks to the spirit of alcohol<br />
Men go for a ride or walk.<br />
<br />
Oh but traffic is not all done<br />
Nor everything yet sold.<br />
There's woman to win, and plots to weave,<br />
There's a heart to hurt, or one to deceive,<br />
And bargains to bind ere rise of Sun<br />
To garner the morrow's gold.<br />
<br />
The market at night is as full of fraud<br />
As the market kept by day.<br />
The courtesan buys a soul with a look,<br />
A dinner tempers the truth in a book,<br />
And love is sold till love is a bawd,<br />
And falsehood froths in the play.<br />
<br />
And men and women sell their smiles<br />
For friendship's lifeless dregs.<br />
For fear of the morrow we bend and bow<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
To moneybags with the slanting brow.<br />
For the heart that knows life's little wiles<br />
Seldom or never begs.<br />
<br />
"Poor men," sighed Helios, "how they long<br />
For the ultimate fire of love.<br />
They yearn, through life, like the peacock moth,<br />
And die worn out in search of the troth.<br />
For love in the soul is the siren song<br />
That wrecks the peace thereof."
<p><span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="spacer">*</span><span class="spacer">*</span><span class="spacer">*</span><span class="spacer">*</span></span></p>
Helios turned from the world and fled<br />
As the convent bell tolled six.<br />
For he caught a glimpse of an agéd crone<br />
Who knelt beside a coffin alone;<br />
She had sold her cloak to shrive the dead<br />
And buy a crucifix!<br /></td></tr></table>

Which smiles at the surcease<br />
Of hope. But there is in your face<br />
The shadow of pain, and there is a trace<br />
Of memory of pain.<br />
<br />
I look at you again and again,<br />
And hide my looks lest your quick eye perceives<br />
My search for your despair.<br />
I look at your pale hands&mdash;I look at your hair;<br />
And I watch you use your hands, I watch the flare<br />
Of thought in your eyes like light that interweaves<br />
A flutter of color running under leaves&mdash;<br />
Such anguished dreams in your eyes!<br />
And I listen to you speak<br />
Words like crystals breaking with a tinkle,<br />
Or a star's twinkle.<br />
Sometimes as we talk you rise<br />
And leave the room, and then I rub a streak<br />
Of a tear from my cheek.<br />
<br />

Of pictures, books, romance<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>

In the varied music of exquisite words,<br />
And in a voice that sings.<br />
<br />
All things are memory now with you,<br />
For poverty girds<br />
Your hopes, and only your dreams remain.<br />
And sometimes here and there<br />
I see as you turn your head a whitened hair,<br />
Even when you are smiling most.<br />
And a light comes in your eyes like a passing ghost,<br />
And a color runs through your cheeks as fresh<br />
As burns in a girl's flesh.<br />
Then I can shut my eyes and feel the pain<br />
That has become a part of you, though I feign<br />
Laughter myself. One sees another's bruise<br />
And shakes his thought out of it shuddering.<br />
So I turn and clamp my will lest I bring<br />
Your sorrow into my flesh, who cannot choose<br />
But hear your words and laughter,<br />
And watch your hands and eyes.<br />
<br />
Then as I think you over after<br />
I have gone from you, and your face<br />
Comes to me with its grace<br />
Of memory of unfound love:<br />
You seem to me the image of all women<br />
Who dream and keep under smiles the grief thereof,<br />
Or sew, or sit by windows, or read books<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
To hide their Secret's looks.<br />
And after a time go out of life and leave<br />
No uttered words but in their silence grieve<br />
For Life and for the things no tongue can tell:<br />
Why Life hurts so, and why Love haunts and hurts<br />
Poor men and women in this demi-hell.<br />
<br />
Perhaps your pathos means that it is well<br />
Death in his time the aspiring torch inverts,<br />
And all tired flesh and haunted eyes and hands<br />
Moving in painéd whiteness are put under<br />
The soothing earth to brighten April's wonder.<br /></td></tr></table>

Clothed in a corset waist and skirt of silk,<br />
Tied with white braid above your slender hips<br />

Between a moonlit sea, pale as your hand,<br />

Over the sovereign largeness of your eyes;<br />
Or at your breasts that shake not as you pull<br />
The comb through stubborn tangles, only rise<br />
Scarcely perceptible with breath or signs,<br />
Firm unmaternal like a young Bacchante's,<br />
Or at your nose profoundly dipped like Dante's<br />
Over your chin that softly melts away.<br />
<br />
Now you seem fully under my heart's sway.<br />
I have slipped through the magic of your mesh<br />
Freed once again and strengthened by your flesh,<br />
You seem a weak thing for a strong man's play.<br />
Yet I know now that we shall scarce have parted<br />
When I shall think of you half heavy hearted.<br />
I know our partings. You will faintly smile<br />
And look at me with eyes that have no guile,<br />
Or have too much, and pass into the sphere<br />
Where you keep independent life meanwhile.<br />
How do you live without me, is the fear?<br />
You do not lean upon me, ask my love, or wonder<br />
Of other loves I may have hidden under<br />
These casual renewals of our love.<br />

Ari, go about re-murmuring your name,<br />

And as I lie here on the imminent brink<br />
Of soul's surrender into your soul's power,<br />
And in the white light of the morning hour<br />
I see what life would be if we should link<br />
Our lives together in a marriage pact:<br />
For we would walk along a boundless tract<br />
Of perfect hell; but your disloyalty<br />
Would be of spirit, for I have not won<br />
Mastered and bound your spirit unto me.<br />

I have you it would not by half betray<br />
My love as does your vague and chainless thought,<br />
Which wanders, soars or vanishes, returns,<br />
Changes, astonishes, or chills or burns,<br />
Is unresisting, plastic, freely wrought<br />
Under my hands yet to no unison<br />
Of my life and of yours. Upon this brink<br />
I watch you now and think<br />
Of all that has been preached or sung or spoken<br />
Of woman's tragedy in woman's fall;<br />
And all the pictures of a woman broken<br />
By man's superior strength.<br />
<br />

Of your resolve as mine is, knowing all<br />
Of man, the master, and his power to harm,<br />
His rulership of spheres material,<br />
Bread, customs, rules of fair repute&mdash;<br />
What are they all against your slender arm?<br />
Which long since plucked the fruit<br />
Of good and evil, and of life at last<br />
And now of Life. For dancing you have cast<br />
Veil after veil of ideals or pretense<br />
With which men clothe the being feminine<br />
To satisfy their lordship or their sense<br />
Of ownership and hide the things of sin&mdash;<br />
You have thrown them aside veil after veil;<br />
And there you stand unarmored, weirdly frail,<br />
Yet strong as nature, making comical<br />
The poems and the tales of woman's fall....<br />
You nod your head, you smile, I feel the air<br />
Made by the closing door. I lie and stare<br />
At the closed door. One, two, your tuftèd steps<br />
Die on the velvet of the outer hall.<br />
You have escaped. And I would not pursue.<br />
Though we are but caged creatures, I and you&mdash;<br />
A male and female tiger in a zoo.<br />
For I shall wait you. Life himself will track<br />
Your wanderings and bring you back,<br />
And shut you up again with me and cage<br />
Our love and hatred and our silent rage.<br /></td></tr></table>

<span style="margin-left: 7em;">And I look up and over</span><br />
The reader's shoulder and see the name of the writer.<br />
What is it I see? The name of a man I knew!<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>You are an ironical trickster, Time, to bring<br />
After so many years and into a place like this<br />
This face before me: hair slicked down and parted<br />
In the middle and cheeks stuck out with fatness,<br />
Plump from camembert and clicquot, eyelids<br />
Thin as skins of onions, cut like dough 'round the eyes.<br />
Such was your look in a photograph I saw<br />
In a silver frame on a woman's dresser&mdash;and such<br />
Your look in life, you thing of flesh alone!<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">And then</span><br />
As a soul looks down on the body it leaves&mdash;<br />
A body by fever slain&mdash;I look on myself<br />
As I was a decade ago, while the letter is read:<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 10em;">I enter a box</span><br />
Of a theater with Jim, my friend of fifty,<br />
I being twenty-two. Two women are in the box<br />
One of an age for Jim and one of an age for me.<br />
And mine is dressed in a dainty gown of dimity,<br />
And she fans herself with a fan of silver spangles<br />
Till a subtle odor of delicate powder or of herself<br />
Enters my blood and I stare at her snowy neck,<br />
And the glossy brownness of her hair until<br />
She feels my stare, and turns half-view and I see<br />
How like a Greek's is her nose, with just a little<br />
Aquiline touch; and I catch the flash of an eye,<br />
And the glint of a smile on the richness of her lips.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>The company now discourses upon the letter<br />
But my dream goes on:<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 9em;">I re-live a rapture</span><br />
Which may be madness, and no man understands<br />
Until he feels it no more. The youth that was I<br />
From the theater under the city's lights follows the girl<br />
Desperate lest in the city's curious chances<br />
He never sees her again. And boldly he speaks.<br />
And she and the older woman, her sister<br />
Smile and speak in turn, and Jim who stands<br />
While I break the ice comes up&mdash;and so<br />
Arm in arm we go to the restaurant,<br />
I in heaven walking with Arabel,<br />
And Jim with her older sister.<br />
We drive them home under a summer moon,<br />
And while I explain to Arabel my boldness,<br />
And crave her pardon for it, Jim, the devil,<br />
Laughs apart with her sister while I wonder<br />
What Jim, the devil, is laughing at. No matter<br />
To-morrow I walk in the park with Arabel.<br />
<br />
Just now the reader of the letter<br />
Tells of the writer's swift descent<br />
From wealth to want.<br />
<br />
We are in the park next afternoon by the water.<br />
I look at her white throat full as it were of song.<br />
And her rounded virginal bosom, beautiful!<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
And I study her eyes, I search to the depths her eyes<br />
In the light of the sun. They are full of little rays<br />
Like the edge of a fleur de lys, and she smiles<br />
At first when I fling my soul at her feet.<br />
<br />
But when I repeat I love her, love her only,<br />
A cloud of wonder passes over her face,<br />
She veils her eyes. The color comes to her cheeks.<br />
And when she picks some clover blossoms and tears them<br />
Her hand is trembling. And when I tell her again<br />
I love her, love her only, she blots her eyes<br />
With a handkerchief to hide a tear that starts.<br />
<br />
And she says to me: "You do not know me at all,<br />
How can you love me? You never saw me before<br />
Last night." "Well, tell me about yourself."<br />
And after a time she tells me the story:<br />
About her father who ran away from her mother;<br />
And how she hated her father, and how she grieved<br />
When her mother died; and how a good grandmother<br />
Helped her and helps her now. And how her sister<br />
Divorced her husband. And then she paused a moment:<br />
"I am not strong, you'd have to guard me gently,<br />
And that takes money, dear, as well as love.<br />
Two years ago I was very ill, and since then<br />
I am not strong."<br />
<br/>
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">"Well I can work," I said.</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span><br />
"And what would you think of a little cottage<br />
Not too far out with a yard and hosts of roses,<br />
And a vine on the porch, and a little garden,<br />
And a dining room where the sun comes in,<br />
When a morning breeze blows over your brow,<br />
And you sit across the table and serve me<br />
And neither of us can speak for happiness<br />
Without our voices breaking, or lips trembling."<br />
<br />
She is looking down with little frowns on her brow.<br />
"But if ever I had to work, I could not do it,<br />
I am not really well."<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">"But I can work," I said.</span><br />
I rise and lift her up, holding her hand.<br />
She slips her arm through mine and presses it.<br />
"What a good man you are," she said. "Just like a brother&mdash;<br />
I almost love you, I believe I love you."<br />
<br />
The reader of the letter, being a doctor,<br />
Is talking learnedly of the writer's case<br />
Which has the classical marks of paresis.<br />
<br />
Next day I look up Jim and rhapsodize<br />
About a cottage with roses and a garden,<br />
And a dining room where the sun comes in,<br />
And Arabel across the table. Jim is smoking<br />
And flicking the ashes, but never says a word<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
Till I have finished. Then in a quiet voice:<br />
"Arabel's sister says that Arabel's straight,<br />
But she isn't, my boy&mdash;she's just like Arabel's sister.<br />
She knew you had the madness for Arabel.<br />
That's why we laughed and stood apart as we talked.<br />
And I'll tell you now I didn't go home that night,<br />
I shook you at the corner and went back,<br />
And staid that night. Now be a man, my boy,<br />
Go have your fling with Arabel, but drop<br />
The cottage and the roses."<br />
<br />
They are still discussing the madman's letter.<br />
<br />
And memory permeates me like a subtle drug:<br />
The memory of my love for Arabel,<br />
The torture, the doubt, the fear, the restless longing,<br />
The sleepless nights, the pity for all her sorrows,<br />
The speculation about her and her sister,<br />
And what her illness was;<br />
And whether the man I saw one time was leaving<br />
Her door or the next door to it, and if her door<br />
Whether he saw my Arabel or her sister....<br />
<br />
The reader of the letter is telling how the writer<br />
Left his wife chasing the lure of women.<br />
<br />
And it all comes back to me as clear as a vision:<br />
The night I sat with Arabel strong but conquered.<br />
Whatever I did, I loved her, whatever she was.<br />
Madness or love the terrible struggle must end.<br />
She took my hand and said, "You must see my room."<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
We stood in the doorway together and on her dresser<br />
Was a silver frame with the photograph of a man&mdash;<br />
I had seen him in life: hair slicked down and parted<br />
In the middle and cheeks stuck out with fatness<br />
Plump from camembert and clicquot, eyelids<br />
Thin as skins of onions, cut like dough 'round the eyes.<br />
"There is his picture," she said, "ask me whatever you will.<br />
Take me as mistress or wife, it is yours to decide.<br />
But take me as mistress and grow like the picture before you,<br />
Take me as wife and be the good man you can be.<br />
Choose me as mistress&mdash;how can I do less for dearest?<br />
Or make me your wife&mdash;fate makes me your mistress or wife."<br />
"I can leave you," I said. "You can leave me," she echoed,<br />
"But how about hate in your heart."<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 10em;">"You are right," I replied.</span><br />
The company is now discussing the subject of love&mdash;<br />
They seem to know little about it.<br />
<br />
But my wife, who is sitting beside me, exclaims:<br />
"Well, what is this jangle of madness and weakness,<br />
What has it to do with poetry, tell me?"<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">"Well, it's life," Arabel.</span><br />
"There's the story of Hamlet, for instance," I added.<br />
Then fell into silence.<br /></td></tr></table>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="5" summary="table">
<tr><td>Last night a friend of mine and I sat talking,<br />
When all at once I found 'twas one o'clock.<br />
So we came out and he went home to wife<br />
And children, and I started for the club<br />
Which I call home; and then just like a flash<br />
You came into my mind. I bought a slug<br />
And stood, in the booth, with doubtful heart and heard<br />
The buzzer buzz. Well, it was sweet to me<br />
To hear your voice at last&mdash;it was so drowsy,<br />
Like a child's voice. And I could see your eyes<br />
Heavy with sleep, and I could see you standing<br />
In nightgown with head leaned against the wall....<br />
<br />
Julia! the welcome of your drowsy voice<br />
Went through me like the warmth of priceless wine&mdash;<br />
It showed your understanding, that you know<br />
How it is with a man, and how it is with me<br />
Who work by day and sometimes drift by night<br />
About this hellish city. Though you know<br />
That I am fifty-one, can you imagine<br />
My feeling with no children growing up?<br />
My feeling as of one who sees a play<br />
And afterwards sits somewhere at a table<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
And talks with friends about the different parts<br />
Over a sandwich and a glass of beer?<br />
My feeling with this money which I've made<br />
And cannot use? Sometimes the stress of working<br />
The money dulls the fancy which could use it<br />
In splendid dreams or in the art of life.<br />
Well, here was I ringing your bell at last<br />
At half-past one, and there you stood before me<br />
With a sleepy voice and a sleepy smile, with hands<br />
So warm, and cheeks so red from sleep, not vexed,<br />
But like a child, awakened, who smiles at you<br />
With half-shut eyes and kisses you, so you<br />
Gave me a kiss. The world seems better, Julia,<br />
For that kiss which you gave me at the door....<br />
<br />
Breakfast? Why, toast and coffee, not too strong,<br />
My heart acts queer of late....<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">I want to say</span><br />
Lest I forget it, if you ever hear<br />
From Arabel or Francis what I said<br />
To Francis when he told me he intended<br />
To marry Arabel, why just remember<br />
Our talk this morning and forget I said it&mdash;<br />
I'm sorry that I said it. But, you see,<br />
That night we met, I being fifty-one<br />
And old at what men call the game, looked on<br />
With steady eye and quiet nerve, I saw you<br />
Just as I'd see a woman anywhere;<br />
Just as I'd see a woman anywhere;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
And I found you as I'd found others before you,<br />
But with this difference so it seemed to me:<br />
What had been false with them was real with you,<br />
What had been shame with them with you was life,<br />
What had been craft with them with you was nature,<br />
What had been sin with them to you was good,<br />
What had been vice with them to you the honest<br />
And uncorrupted innocence of a human<br />
Heart so human looking on our souls.<br />
What had been coarse to them to you was clean<br />
As rain is, or fresh flowers, all things that grow<br />
And move and sing along creation's way.<br />
You came to me like friendship, what you gave<br />
Was friendship's gift, when friends think least of self<br />
And least of motive. And it is through you<br />
That I have risen out of the pit where sneers<br />
And laughter, looks and words obscene,<br />
Blaspheme our nature. It is through you, Julia,<br />
As one amid great beach trees where soft mosses<br />
Pillow our heads and where we see the clouds<br />
Upon their infinite sailings and the lake<br />
Washes beneath us, and we lie and think<br />
How this has been forever and will be<br />
When we are dust a thousand, thousand years,<br />
Yet how life is eternal&mdash;just as one<br />
Who there falls into prayer for ecstasy<br />
Of wonder, prophecy could not blaspheme<br />
The Eternal Power (as he might well blaspheme<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
The gospel hymns and ritual) that I<br />
Cannot blaspheme you, Julia.<br />
For what is our communion, yours and mine,<br />
If it be not a way of laying hold<br />
On that mysterious essence which makes one<br />
Of heaven and earth, makes kindred human hands....<br />
Tears are not like you, Julia; laugh, that's right!<br />
Pour me a little coffee, if you please.<br />
<br />
I'll take from my herbarium certain species<br />
To make my points: Now here there is the woman<br />
Of life promiscuous, or nearly so.<br />
She fixes her design upon a man,<br />
Who's married and the riotous game begins.<br />
They go along a year or two perhaps.<br />
Then psychic chemistry performs its part:<br />
They are in love, or he's in love with her.<br />
What shall be done with love? Now watch the woman:<br />
That which she gave without love at the first<br />
She now withdraws in spite of love unless<br />
He breaks his life up, cuts all former ties<br />
And weds her. Do you wonder sometimes men<br />
Kill women with a knife or strangle them?<br />
Well, here's another: She has been to Ogontz,<br />
You meet her at a dinner-dance, we'll say.<br />
She has green eyes and hair as light as jonquils;<br />
She wears black velvet and a salmon sash.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
And when you dance with her she has a way<br />
Of giving you her flesh beneath thin silk,<br />
Which almost lisps as she caresses you<br />
With legs that scarcely touch you; and she says<br />
Things with a double meaning, and she smiles<br />
To carry out her meaning. Well, you think<br />
The girl is yours, and after weeks of chasing<br />
She lands you up at the appointed place<br />
With mamma, who looks at you with big eyes,<br />
That have a nervous way of opening<br />
And closing slowly like a big wax doll's,<br />
From which great clouds of wrath and wonder come;<br />
Which meeting is a way of saying to you:<br />
The girl is yours if you will marry her,<br />
And let her have your money.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">Julia, be still;</span><br />
I can't go on while you are laughing so.<br />
I know that men are easy, but to see<br />
Women as women see them is a gift<br />
That comes to men who reach my age in life....<br />
<br />
Well, here's another, here's the type of woman<br />
Whose power of motherhood conceals the art<br />
By which she thrives, through which she reaches also<br />
An apotheosis in society.<br />
Her dream is children conscious or unconscious.<br />
And her strength is the race's, and she draws<br />
The urgings of posterity and leans<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
Upon the hopes and ideals of the day.<br />
To her a man must sacrifice his life.<br />
But women, Julia, of whatever type,<br />
Are still but waiting ovules seeking man,<br />
And man's life to develop, even to live.<br />
And like the praying mantis who's devoured<br />
In the embrace, man is devoured by women<br />
In some way, by some sort. Love is a flame<br />
In man's life where he warms him but to suck<br />
The invisible heat and perish. Life is cramped,<br />
Bound down with many ropes, shut in by gates&mdash;<br />
Love is not free which should be wholly free<br />
For Life's sake.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">On Michigan Avenue</span><br />
At lunch time, or at five o'clock, you'll see<br />
In rain or shine a certain tailor walk<br />
In modish coat and trousers, with a cane.<br />
That fellow is the pitifulest man I know.<br />
He has no woman, cannot find a woman,<br />
Because all women, seeing him, divine<br />
What surges through him, and within their hearts<br />
Laugh slyly and deny him for the fun<br />
Of seeing how denial keeps him walking<br />
All up and down the boulevard. He's found<br />
No hand of human friendship like yours, Julia.<br />
I use him for my point. If we could make<br />
Some fine erotometer one could sit<br />
And watch its trembling springs and nervous hands<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
Record the waves of longing in the city,<br />
And the urge of life that writhes beneath the blows<br />
Of custom and of fear. Love is not free,<br />
Which should be wholly free for Life's sake.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">Julia.</span><br />
So much for all these things, and now for you<br />
To whom they lead.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">You'll find among the marshes</span><br />
The sundew and the pitcher plant; in shallows,<br />
Where the green scum floats languidly you'll find<br />
The water lily with white petals and<br />
A sickly perfume. But the sundew catches<br />
The midges flitting by with rainbow wings,<br />
Impales them on its tiny spines, in time<br />
Devours them. And the pitcher plant holds out<br />
Its cup of green for larger bugs, which fall<br />
Into the water, treasured there like tears<br />
Of women, and so drowned are soon absorbed<br />
Into the verdant vesture of its leaves.<br />
The pitcher plant and sundew, water lily<br />
Well typify the nature of most women<br />
Who must have blood or soul of man to live&mdash;<br />
Except you, Julia. For my friend at Hinsdale<br />
Who raises flowers laid out a primrose bed.<br />
He read somewhere that primroses will change<br />
Under your eyes sometimes to something else,<br />
Become another flower and not a primrose,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
Another species even. So he watched<br />
And saw it, saw this miracle! The seed<br />
Has somewhere in its vital self the power<br />
Of this mutation. What is the origin<br />
Of spiritual species? For you're a primrose, Julia,<br />
Who has mutated: You are not a mother;<br />
Nor are you yet the woman seeking marriage;<br />
Nor yet the woman thriving by her sex;<br />
Nor yet the woman spoken of by Solomon<br />
Who waits and watches and whose steps lead down<br />
To death and hell. Nor yet Delilah who<br />
Rejoices in the secret of man's strength<br />
And in subduing it.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">You are a flower</span><br />
Designed to comfort such poor men as I,<br />
And show the world how love can be a thing<br />
That asks no more than what it freely gives,<br />
And gives all&mdash;all some women call the prize<br />
For life or honor, riches, power or place.<br />
You are a blossom in the primrose bed<br />
So raised to subtler color, sweeter scent.<br />
You have mutated, Julia, that is it,<br />
This flower of you is what I call <i>The Lover</i>!<br /></td></tr></table>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="5" summary="table">
<tr><td>I have seen many faces changed by the Sculptor Death&mdash;<br />
But never a face like Harold's who passed in a throe of pain.<br />
There were maidens and youths in the bud, and men in the lust of life;<br />
And women whom child-birth racked till the crying soul slipped through;<br />
Patriarchs withered with age and nuns ascetical white;<br />
And one who wasted her virgin wealth in a riot of joy.<br />
Brothers and sisters at last in a quiet and purple pall,<br />
Fellow voyagers bound to a port on an ash-blue sea,<br />
Locked in an utterless grief, in a mystery fearful to dream.<br />
All of these I have seen&mdash;but the face of Harold the bold<br />
Looked with a penitent pallor and stared with a sad surprise.<br />

For now at last he was still who never knew rest in life.<br />
And the ardent heat of his blood was cold as the sweat of a stone.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
Life came in an evil hour and stabbed with a poisoned word<br />
The heart of a girl who faintly smiled through her tears.<br />
And her little life was tossed as the eddies that whirl in the hollows<br />
From the great world-currents that wreck the battle ships at sea.<br />
And the face of dead Lillian seemed like a rain-ruined flower.<br />
<br />
Or what is writ on the brow of the babe as the mother wails for the day<br />
When it leaped in the light of the sun and babbled its pure delight?<br />
<br />
But the face of William the Great was fashioned by life and thought;<br />
And death made it massive as bronze, and deepened the lines thereof:<br />
Some for the will and some for patience, and some for hope&mdash;<br />
Hope for the weal of the world wherein he mightily strove&mdash;<br />
Yet what did it all bespeak&mdash;what but submission and awe,<br />
And a trace of pain as one with a sword in his side?<br />

I have seen many faces changed by the Sculptor Death<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span><br />

Atom with atom massed, You would go on<br />

Would be a molecule, a little system<br />
Wherein the atoms move like suns and planets<br />
With satellites, electrons. So as worlds build<br />

To something else&mdash;that man must pass as well<br />
Through equal transformation. And You knew<br />
The unutterable things of man's life: From the first<br />
You saw his wracked Deucalion-soul that looks<br />
Backward on life that rises, where he rose<br />
Out of the stones. You saw him looking forward<br />
Over the purple mists that hide the gulf.<br />
Ere the green cell rose, even in the green cell<br />
You saw the sequences of thought&mdash;You saw<br />
That one would say, "All's matter" and another,<br />
"All's mind," and man's mind which reflects the image,<br />
Could not envision it. That even worship<br />
Of what you are would be confused by cries<br />
From India or Palestine. That love<br />
Which sees itself beginning in the seeds,<br />
Which fly and seek each other, maims<br />
The soul at the last in loss of child or friend<br />
Father or mother. And You knew that sex,<br />
Ranging from plants through beasts and up to us<br />
Had ties of filth&mdash;And out of them would rise<br />
Diverse philosophies to tear the world.<br />
You knew, when the green cell arose, that even<br />
The You which formed it moving on would bring<br />
Races and breeds, madmen, tyrants, slaves,<br />
The idiot child, the murderer, the insane&mdash;<br />
All springing from the action of one law.<br />
You knew the enmity that lies between<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
The lives of micro-beings and our own. You knew<br />
How man would rise to vision of himself:<br />
Immortal only in the race's life.<br />
And past the atom and the first glint of life,<br />

The germinal cell of vaster evolution.<br />
Why try to tell you? If I gave a cell<br />
Voice to inquire, and it should ask you this:<br />
"After me what, a stalk, a flower, life<br />
That swims or crawls?" And if I gave to you<br />
Wisdom to say: "You shall become a reed<br />
By the water's edge"&mdash;how could the cell foresee<br />
What the reed is, bending beneath the wind<br />
When the lake ripples and the skies are blue<br />
As larkspur? Therefore I, who moved in darkness<br />
Becoming light in suns and light in souls<br />

As I am lost not. Therefore be at peace.<br />
And from the laws whose orbits cross and run<br />
To seeming tangles, find the law through which<br />
Your soul shall be perfected till it draw,&mdash;<br />
As the green cell the sunlight draws and turns<br />
Its chemical effulgence into life&mdash;<br />
My inner splendor. All the rest is mine<br />
In infinite time. For if I should unroll<br />
The parchment of the future, it were vain&mdash;<br />

Ere Launcelot arrive."<br />
<br />
Elaine stole forth with twenty knights<br />
And a goodly company.<br />
Sir Launcelot rode fast behind,<br />
Queen Guinevere to see.<br />
<br/>
Anon he reached the castle door.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span><br />
Oh! fond and well deceived.<br />
And there it seemed the queen's own train<br />
Sir Launcelot received.<br />
<br />
"Where is the queen?" quoth Launcelot,<br />
"For I am sore bestead,"<br />
"Have not such haste," said Dame Brisen,<br />
"The queen is now in bed."<br />
<br />
"Then lead me thither," saith he,<br />
"And cease this jape of thine."<br />
"Now sit thee down," said Dame Brisen,<br />
"And have a cup of wine."<br />
<br />
"For wit ye not that many eyes<br />
Upon you here have stared;<br />
Now have a cup of wine until<br />
All things may be prepared."<br />
<br />
Elaine lay in a fair chamber,<br />
'Twixt linen sweet and clene.<br />
Dame Brisen all the windows stopped,<br />
That no day might be seen.<br />
<br />
Dame Brisen fetched a cup of wine<br />
And Launcelot drank thereof.<br />
"No more of flagons," saith he,<br />
"For I am mad for love."<br />
<br/>
Dame Brisen took Sir Launcelot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span><br />
Where lay the maid Elaine.<br />
Sir Launcelot entered the bed chamber<br />
The queen's love for to gain.<br />
<br />
Sir Launcelot kissed the maid Elaine,<br />
And her cheeks and brows did burn;<br />
And then they lay in other's arms<br />
Until the morn's underne.<br />
<br />
Anon Sir Launcelot arose<br />
And toward the window groped,<br />
And then he saw the maid Elaine<br />
When he the window oped.<br />
<br />
"Ah, traitoress," saith Launcelot,<br />
And then he gat his sword,<br />
"That I should live so long and now<br />
Become a knight abhorred."<br />
<br />
"False traitoress," saith Launcelot,<br />
And then he shook the steel.<br />
Elaine skipped naked from the bed<br />
And 'fore the knight did kneel.<br />
<br />
"I am King Pelles own daughter<br />
And thou art Launcelot,<br />
The greatest knight of all the world.<br />
This hour we have begot."<br />
<br/>
"Oh, traitoress Brisen," cried the knight,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span><br />
"Oh, charmed cup of wine;<br />
That I this treasonous thing should do<br />
For treasures such as thine."<br />
<br />
"Have mercy," saith maid Elaine,<br />
"Thy child is in my womb."<br />
Thereat the morning's silvern light<br />
Flooded the bridal room.<br />
<br />
That light it was a benison;<br />
It seemed a holy boon,<br />
As when behind a wrack of cloud<br />
Shineth the summer moon.<br />
<br />
And in the eyes of maid Elaine<br />
Looked forth so sweet a faith,<br />
Sir Launcelot took his glittering sword,<br />
And thrust it in the sheath.<br />
<br />
"So God me help, I spare thy life,<br />
But I am wretch and thrall,<br />
If any let my sword to make<br />
Dame Brisen's head to fall."<br />
<br />
"So have thy will of her," she said,<br />
"But do to me but good;<br />
For thou hast had my fairest flower,<br />
Which is my maidenhood."<br />
<br/>
"And we have done the will of God,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span><br />
And the will of God is best."<br />
Sir Launcelot lifted the maid Elaine<br />
And hid her on his breast.<br />
<br />
Anon there cometh in a dove,<br />
By the window's open fold,<br />
And in her mouth was a rich censer<br />
That shone like beaten gold.<br />
<br />
And therewithal was such savor,<br />
As bloweth over sea,<br />
From a land of many colored flowers,<br />
And trees of spicery.<br />
<br />
And therewithal was meat and drink,<br />
And a damsel passing fair,<br />
Betwixt her hands of silver white<br />
A golden cup did bear.<br />
<br />
"O Jesu," said Sir Launcelot,<br />
"What may this marvel mean?"<br />
"That is," she said, "the richest thing<br />
That any man hath seen."<br />
<br />
"O Jesu," said Sir Launcelot,<br />
"What may this sight avail?"<br />
"Now wit ye well," said maid Elaine,<br />
"This is the Holy Grail."<br />
<br/>
And then a nimbus light hung o'er<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span><br />
Her brow so fair and meek;<br />
And turned to orient pearls the tears<br />
That glistered down her cheek.<br />
<br />
And a sound of music passing sweet<br />
Went in and out again.<br />
Sir Launcelot made the sign of the cross,<br />
And knelt to maid Elaine.<br />
<br />
"Name him whatever name thou wilt,<br />
But be his sword and mail<br />
Thrice tempered 'gainst a wayward world,<br />
That lost the Holy Grail."<br />
<br />
Sir Launcelot sadly took his leave<br />
And rode against the morn.<br />
And when the time was fully come<br />
Sir Galahad was born.<br />
<br />
Also he was from Jesu Christ,<br />
Our Lord, the eighth degree;<br />
Likewise the greatest knight this world<br />
May ever hope to see.<br /></td></tr></table>

<p class="center"><span class="huge">THE DEATH OF SIR LAUNCELOT</span></p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="5" summary="table">
<tr><td>Sir Launcelot had fled to France<br />
For the peace of Guinevere,<br />
And many a noble knight was slain,<br />
And Arthur lay on his bier.<br />
<br />
Sir Launcelot took ship from France<br />
And sailed across the sea.<br />
He rode seven days through fair England<br />
Till he came to Almesbury.<br />
<br />
Then spake Sir Bors to Launcelot:<br />
The old time is at end;<br />
You have no more in England's realm<br />
In east nor west a friend.<br />
<br />
You have no friend in all England<br />
Sith Mordred's war hath been,<br />
And Queen Guinevere became a nun<br />
To heal her soul of sin.<br />
<br />
Sir Launcelot answered never a word<br />
But rode to the west countree<br />
Until through the forest he saw a light<br />
That shone from a nunnery.<br />
<br/>
Sir Launcelot entered the cloister,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span><br />
And the queen fell down in a swoon.<br />
Oh blessed Jesu, saith the queen,<br />
For thy mother's love, a boon.<br />
<br />
Go hence, Sir Launcelot, saith the queen,<br />
And let me win God's grace.<br />
My heavy heart serves me no more<br />
To look upon thy face.<br />
<br />
Through you was wrought King Arthur's death,<br />
Through you great war and wrake.<br />
Leave me alone, let me bleed,<br />
Pass by for Jesu's sake.<br />
<br />
Then fare you well, saith Launcelot,<br />
Sweet Madam, fare you well.<br />
And sythen you have left the world<br />
No more in the world I dwell.<br />
<br />
Then up rose sad Sir Launcelot<br />
And rode by wold and mere<br />
Until he came to a hermitage<br />
Where bode Sir Bedivere.<br />
<br />
And there he put a habit on<br />
And there did pray and fast.<br />
And when Sir Bedivere told him all<br />
His heart for sorrow brast.<br />
<br/>
How that Sir Mordred, traitorous knight
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span><br/>
Betrayed his King and sire;<br />
And how King Arthur wounded, died<br />
Broken in heart's desire.<br />
<br />
And so Sir Launcelot penance made,<br />
And worked at servile toil;<br />
And prayed the Bishop of Canterbury<br />
His sins for to assoil.<br />
<br />
His shield went clattering on the wall<br />
To a dolorous wail of wind;<br />
His casque was rust, his mantle dust<br />
With spider webs entwined.<br />
<br />
His listless horses left alone<br />
Went cropping where they would,<br />
To see the noblest knight of the world<br />
Upon his sorrow brood.<br />
<br />
Anon a Vision came in his sleep,<br />
And thrice the Vision saith:<br />
Go thou to Almesbury for thy sin,<br />
Where lieth the queen in death.<br />
<br />
Sir Launcelot cometh to Almesbury<br />
And knelt by the dead queen's bier;<br />
Oh none may know, moaned Launcelot,<br />
What sorrow lieth here.<br />
<br/>
What love, what honor, what defeat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span><br />
What hope of the Holy Grail.<br />
The moon looked through the latticed glass<br />
On the queen's face cold and pale.<br />
<br />
Sir Launcelot kissed the ceréd cloth,<br />
And none could stay his woe,<br />
Her hair lay back from the oval brow,<br />
And her nose was clear as snow.<br />
<br />
They wrapped her body in cloth of Raines,<br />
They put her in webs of lead.<br />
They coffined her in white marble,<br />
And sang a mass for the dead.<br />
<br />
Sir Launcelot and seven knights<br />
Bore torches around the bier.<br />
They scattered myrrh and frankincense<br />
On the corpse of Guinevere.<br />
<br />
They put her in earth by King Arthur<br />
To the chant of a doleful tune.<br />
They heaped the earth on Guinevere<br />
And Launcelot fell in a swoon.<br />
<br />
Sir Launcelot went to the hermitage<br />
Some Grace of God to find;<br />
But never he ate, and never he drank<br />
And there he sickened and dwined.<br />
<br/>
Sir Launcelot lay in a painful bed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span><br />
And spake with a dreary steven;<br />
Sir Bishop, I pray you shrive my soul<br />
And make it clean for heaven.<br />
<br />
The Bishop houseled Sir Launcelot,<br />
The Bishop kept watch and ward.<br />
Bury me, saith Sir Launcelot,<br />
In the earth of Joyous Guard.<br />
<br />
Three candles burned the whole night through<br />
Till the red dawn looked in the room.<br />
And the white, white soul of Launcelot<br />
Strove with a black, black doom.<br />
<br />
I see the old witch Dame Brisen,<br />
And Elaine so straight and tall&mdash;<br />
Nay, saith the Bishop of Canterbury,<br />
The shadows dance on the wall.<br />
<br />
I see long hands of dead women,<br />
They clutch for my soul eftsoon;<br />
Nay, saith the Bishop of Canterbury,<br />
'Tis the drifting light of the moon.<br />
<br />
I see three angels, saith he,<br />
Before a silver urn.<br />
Nay, saith the Bishop of Canterbury,<br />
The candles do but burn.<br />
<br/>
I see a cloth of red samite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span><br />
O'er the holy vessels spread.<br />
Nay, saith the Bishop of Canterbury,<br />
The great dawn groweth red.<br />
<br />
I see all the torches of the world<br />
Shine in the room so clear.<br />
Nay, saith the Bishop of Canterbury,<br />
The white dawn draweth near.<br />
<br />
Sweet lady, I behold the face<br />
Of thy dear son, our Lord,<br />
Nay, saith the Bishop of Canterbury,<br />
The sun shines on your sword.<br />
<br />
Sir Galahad outstretcheth hands<br />
And taketh me ere I fail&mdash;<br />
Sir Launcelot's body lay in death<br />
As his soul found the Holy Grail.<br />
<br />
They laid his body in the quire<br />
Upon a purple pall.<br />
He was the meekest, gentlest knight<br />
That ever ate in hall.<br />
<br />
He was the kingliest, goodliest knight<br />
That ever England roved,<br />
The truest lover of sinful man<br />
That ever woman loved.<br />
<br/>
I pray you all, fair gentlemen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span><br />
Pray for his soul and mine.<br />
He lived to lose the heart he loved<br />
And drink but bitter wine.<br />
<br />
He wrought a woe he knew not of,<br />
He failed his fondest quest,<br />
Now sing a psalter, read a prayer<br />
May all souls find their rest.<br />

<tr><td>You wrote:<br />
"Come over to Saugatuck<br />
And be with me on the warm sand,<br />
And under cool beeches and aromatic cedars."<br />
And just then no one could do a thing in the city<br />
For the lure of far places, and something that tugged<br />
At one's heart because of a June sky,<br />
And stretches of blue water,<br />
And a warm wind blowing from the south.<br />
What could I do but take a boat<br />
And go to meet you?<br />
<br />
And when to-day is not enough,<br />
But you must live to-morrow also;<br />
And when the present stands in the way<br />
Of something to come,<br />
And there is but one you would see,<br />
All the interval of waiting is a wall.<br />
And so it was I walked the landward deck<br />
With flapping coat and hat pulled down;<br />
And I sat on the leeward deck and looked<br />
At the streaming smoke of the funnels,<br />
And the far waste of rhythmical water,<br />
And at the gulls flying by our side.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
There was music on board and dancing,<br />
But I could not take part.<br />
For above all there was the bluest sky,<br />
And around us the urge of magical distances.<br />
And just because you were in the violins,<br />
And in everything, and were wholly the world<br />
Of sense and sight,<br />
It was too much. One could not live it<br />
And make it all his own&mdash;<br />
It was too much.<br />
And I wondered where the rest could be going,<br />
Or what they thought of water and sky<br />
Without knowing you.<br />
<br />
But at four o'clock there was a rim,<br />
A circled edge of rainbow color<br />
Which suspired, widened and narrowed under your gaze:<br />
It was the phantasy of straining eyes,<br />
Or land&mdash;and it was land.<br />
It was distant trees.<br />
And then it was dunes, bluffs of yellow sand.<br />
We began to wonder how far it was&mdash;<br />
Five miles, or ten miles&mdash;<br />
Surely only five miles!&mdash;<br />
But at last whatever it was we swung to the end.<br />
We rounded the lighthouse pier,<br />
Almost before we knew.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
We slowed our speed in a dizzy river of black,<br />
We drifted softly to dock.<br />
<br />
I took the ferry,<br />
I crossed the river,<br />
I ran almost through the little batch<br />
Of fishermen's shacks.<br />
I climbed the winding road of the hill,<br />
And dove in a shadowy quiet<br />
Of paths of moss and dancing leaves,<br />
And straight stretched limbs of giant pines<br />
On patches of sky.<br />
I ran to the top of the bluff<br />
Where the lodge-house stood.<br />
And there the sunlit lake burst on me<br />
And wine-like air.<br />
And below me was the beach<br />
Where the serried lines of hurrying water<br />
Came up like rank on rank of men<br />
And fell with a shout on the rocks!<br />
I plunged, I stumbled, I ran<br />
Down the hill,<br />
For I thought I saw you,<br />
And it was you, you were there!<br />
And I shall never forget your cry,<br />
Nor how you raised your arms and cried,<br />
And laughed when you saw me.<br />
And there we were with the lake<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
And the sun with his ruddy search-light blaze<br />
Stretching back to lost Chicago.<br />
The sun, the lake, the beach, and ourselves<br />
Were all that was left of Time,<br />
All else was lost.<br />
<br />
You were making a camp.<br />
You had bent from the bank a cedar bough<br />
And tied it down.<br />
And over it flung a quilt of many colors,<br />
And under it spread on the voluptuous silt<br />
Gray blankets and canvas pillows.<br />
I saw it all in a glance.<br />
And there in dread of eyes we stood<br />
Scanning the bluff and the beach,<br />
Lest in the briefest touch of lips<br />
We might be seen.<br />
<br />
For there were eyes, or we thought<br />
There were eyes, on the porch of the lodge,<br />
And eyes along the forest's rim on the hill,<br />
And eyes on the shore.<br />
But a minute past there was no sun,<br />
Only a star that shone like a match which lights<br />
To a blue intenseness amid the glow of a hearth.<br />
And we sat on the sand as dusk came down<br />
In a communion of silence and low words.<br />
Till you said at last: "We'll sup at the lodge,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
Then say good night to me and leave<br />
As if to stay overnight in the village.<br />
But instead make a long detour through the wood<br />
And come to the shore through that ravine,<br />
Be here at the tent at midnight."<br />
<br />
And so I did.<br />
I stole through echoless ways,<br />
Where no twigs broke and where I heard<br />
My heart beat like a watch under a pillow.<br />
And the whippoorwills were singing.<br />
And the sound of the surf below me<br />
Was the sound of silver-poplar leaves<br />
In a wind that makes no pause....<br />
I hurried down the steep ravine,<br />
And a bat flew up at my feet from the brush<br />
And crossed the moon.<br />
To my left was the lighthouse,<br />
And black and deep purples far away,<br />
And all was still.<br />
Till I stood breathless by the tent<br />
And heard your whispered welcome,<br />
And felt your kiss.<br />
<br />
Lovers lay at mid-night<br />
On roofs of Memphis and Athens<br />
And looked at tropical stars<br />
As large as golden beetles.<br />
Nothing is new, save this,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
And this is always new.<br />
And there in your tent<br />
With the balm of the mid-night breeze<br />
Sweeping over us,<br />
We looked at one great star<br />
Through a flap of your many-colored tent,<br />
And the eternal quality of rapture<br />
And mystery and vision flowed through us.<br />
<br />
Next day we went to Grand Haven,<br />
For my desire was your desire,<br />
Whatever wish one had the other had.<br />
And up the Grand River we rowed,<br />
With rushes and lily pads about us,<br />
And the sand hills back of us,<br />
Till we came to a quiet land,<br />
A lotus place of farms and meadows.<br />
And we tied our boat to Schmitty's dock,<br />
Where we had a dinner of fish.<br />
And where, after resting, to follow your will<br />
We drifted back to Spring Lake&mdash;<br />
And under a larger moon,<br />
Now almost full,<br />
Walked three miles to The Beeches,<br />
By a winding country road,<br />
Where we had supper.<br />
And afterwards a long sleep,<br />
Waking to the song of robins.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
And that day I said:<br />
There are wild places, blue water, pine forests,<br />
There are apple orchards, and wonderful roads<br />
Around Elk Lake&mdash;shall we go?<br />
And we went, for your desire was mine.<br />
And there we climbed hills,<br />
And ate apples along the shaded ways,<br />
And rolled great boulders down the steeps<br />
To watch them splash in the water.<br />
And we stood and wondered what was beyond<br />
The farther shore two miles away.<br />
And we came to a place on the shore<br />
Where four great pine trees stood,<br />
And underneath them wild flowers to the edge<br />
Of sand so soft for naked feet.<br />
And here, for not a soul was near,<br />
We stripped and swam far out, laughing, rejoicing,<br />
Rolling and diving in those great depths<br />
Of bracing water under a glittering sun.<br />
<br />
There were farm houses enough<br />
For food and shelter.<br />
But something urged us on.<br />
One knows the end and dreads the end<br />
Yet seeks the end.<br />
And you asked, "Is there a town near?<br />
Let's see a town."<br />
So we walked to Traverse City<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
Through cut-over land and blasted<br />
Trunks and stumps of pine,<br />
And by the side of desolate hills.<br />
But when we got to Traverse City<br />
You were not content, nor was I.<br />
Something urged us on.<br />
Then you thought of Northport<br />
And of its Norse and German fishermen,<br />
And its quaint piers where they smoke fish.<br />
So we drove for thirty miles<br />
In a speeding automobile<br />
Over hills, around sudden curves, into warm coverts,<br />
Or hollows, sometimes at the edge of the Bay,<br />
Again on the hill,<br />
From where we could see Old Mission<br />
Amid blues and blacks, across a score of miles of the Bay,<br />
Waving like watered silk under the moon!<br />
And by meadows of clover newly cut,<br />
And by peach orchards and vineyards.<br />
But when we came to the little town<br />
Already asleep, though it was but eight o'clock,<br />
And only a few drowsy lamps<br />
With misty eyelids shone from a store or two,<br />
I said, "Do you see those twinkling lights?<br />
That's Northport Point, that's the Cedar Cabin&mdash;<br />
Let's go to the Cedar Cabin."<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
And so we crossed the Bay<br />
Amid great waves in a plunging launch,<br />
And a roaring breeze and a great moon,<br />
For now the moon was full.<br />
<br />
So here was the Cedar Cabin<br />
On a strip of land as wide as a house and lawn,<br />
And on one side Lake Michigan,<br />
And on one side the Bay.<br />
There were distances of color all around,<br />
And stars and darknesses of land and trees,<br />
And at the point the lighthouse.<br />
And over us the moon,<br />
And over the balcony of our room<br />
All of these, where we lay till I slept,<br />
Listening to the water of the lake,<br />
And the water of the Bay.<br />
And we saw the moon sink like a red bomb,<br />
And we saw the stars change<br />
As the sky wheeled....<br />
Now this was the end of the earth,<br />
For this strip of land<br />
Ran out to a point no larger than one of the stumps<br />
We saw on the desolate hills.<br />
And moreover it seemed to dive under,<br />
Or waste away in a sudden depth of water.<br />
And around it was a swirl,<br />
To the north the bounding waves of the Lake,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
And to the south the Bay which seemed the Lake.<br />
But could we speak of it, even though<br />
I saw your eyes when you thought of it?<br />
A sigh of wind blew through the rustic temple<br />
When we saw this symbol together,<br />
And neither spoke.<br />
But that night, somewhere in the beginning of drowsiness,<br />
You said: "There is no further place to go,<br />
We must retrace."<br />
And I awoke in a torrent of light in the room,<br />
Hearing voices and steps on the walk:<br />
I looked for you,<br />
But you had arisen.<br />
Then I dressed and searched for you,<br />
But you were gone.<br />
Then I stood for long minutes<br />
Looking at a sail far out at sea<br />
And departed too.<br /></td></tr></table>

And clasped hands and said "Gone, all gone."<br />
By other pools there were dead bodies:<br />
Some of youth, some of age.<br />
They had given up the fight,<br />
They had drunk poisoned water,<br />
They had searched<br />
Until they fell&mdash;<br />
All had gone mad!<br />
<br />
Then I, a certain god,<br />
Curious to know<br />
What it is in pools and stars<br />
That drives men and women<br />
Over the earth in this quest<br />
Waited for mad Frederick.<br />
And then I heard his step.<br />
<br />
I knew that long ago<br />
He sat by one of these pools<br />
Enraptured of a star's image.<br />
And that hands, for his own good,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
As they said,<br />
Dumped clay into the pool<br />
And blotted his star.<br />
And I knew that after that<br />
He had said, "They will never spy again<br />
Upon my ecstasy.<br />
They will never see me watching one star.<br />
I will fly by rivers,<br />
And by little brooks,<br />
And by the edge of lakes,<br />
And by little bends of water,<br />
Where no wind blows,<br />
And glance at stars as I pass.<br />
They will never spy again<br />
Upon my ecstasy."<br />
<br />
And I knew that mad Frederick<br />
In this flight<br />
Through years of restless and madness<br />
Was caught by the image of a star<br />
In a mere beyond a meadow<br />
Down from a hill, under a forest,<br />
And had said,<br />
"No one sees;<br />
Here I can find life,<br />
Through vision of eternal things."<br />
But they had followed him.<br />
They stood on the brow of the hill,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
And when they saw him gazing in the water<br />
They rolled a great stone down the hill,<br />
And shattered the star's image.<br />
Then mad Frederick fled with laughter.<br />
It echoed through the wood.<br />
And he said, "I will look for moons,<br />
I will punish them who disturb me,<br />
By worshiping moons."<br />
But when he sought moons<br />
They left him alone,<br />
And he did not want the moons.<br />
And he was alone, and sick from the moons,<br />
And covered as with a white blankness,<br />
Which was the worst madness of all.<br />
<br />
And I, a certain god,<br />
Waiting for mad Frederick<br />
To enter this place of pools and stars,<br />
Saw him at last.<br />
With a sigh he looked about upon his fellows<br />
Sitting or standing by their pools.<br />
And some of the pools were covered with scum,<br />
And some were glazed as of filth,<br />
And some were grown with weeds,<br />
And some were congealed as of the north wind,<br />
And a few were yet pure,<br />
And held the star's image.<br />
And by these some sat and were glad,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
Others had lost the vision.<br />
The star was there, but its meaning vanished.<br />
And mad Frederick, going here and there,<br />
With no purpose,<br />
Only curious and interested<br />
As I was, a certain god,<br />
Came by a certain pool<br />
And saw a star.<br />
<br />
He shivered,<br />
He clasped his hands,<br />
He sank to his knees,<br />
He touched his lips to the water.<br />
<br />
Then voices from the limbs of the trees muttered:<br />
"There he is again."<br />
"He must be driven away."<br />
"The pool is not his."<br />
"He does not belong here."<br />
So as when bats fly in a cave<br />
They swooped from their hidings in the trees<br />
And dashed themselves in the pool.<br />
Then I saw what these flying things were&mdash;<br />
But no matter.<br />
They were illusions, evil and envious<br />
And dull,<br />
But with power to destroy.<br />
And mad Frederick turned away from the pool<br />
And covered his eyes with his arms.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
Then a certain god,<br />
Of less power than mine,<br />
Came and sat beside me and said:<br />
"Why do you allow this to be?<br />
They are all seeking,<br />
Why do you not let them find their heart's delight?<br />
Why do you allow this to be?"<br />
But I did not answer.<br />
The lesser god did not know<br />
That I have no power,<br />
That only the God has the power.<br />
And that this must be<br />
In spite of all lesser gods.<br />
<br />
And I saw mad Frederick<br />
Arise and ascend to the top of a high hill,<br />
And I saw him find the star<br />
Whose image he had seen in the pool.<br />
Then he knelt and prayed:<br />
"Give me to understand, O Star,<br />
Your inner self, your eternal spirit,<br />
That I may have you and not images of you,<br />
So that I may know what has driven me through the world,<br />
And may cure my soul.<br />
For I know you are Eternal Love,<br />
And I can never escape you.<br />
And if I cannot escape you,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
Then I must serve you.<br />
And if I must serve you,<br />
It must be to good and not ill&mdash;<br />
You have brought me from the forest of pools<br />
And the images of stars,<br />
Here to the hill's top.<br />
Where now do I go?<br />
And what shall I do?"<br /></td></tr></table>

<p>Here with that intensely human note exhibited
in his poems of the working classes, Mr. Gibson
sings of the life of the soldier. There are many
moods in the book, for the author has well caught
the flow of spirits from gaiety to despair which
makes up the soldier's days. The chief characteristic
of the little pen pictures is their vividness, the
way in which they bring before the reader the
thoughts and feelings of those whose lives may be
offered up for their country any moment. In addition
to these poems of battle there are others in the
collection on varying themes.</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
